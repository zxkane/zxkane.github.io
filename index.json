But what about serverless for data warehouses? Let's delve into the fascinating (and sometimes confusing) world of Redshift Serverless: its cost structure, ideal use cases, and situations where it might not be the best fit.\nCost Breakdown: Beyond the Illusion of Free Redshift Serverless offers a compelling promise: only pay for what you use. But like any good magic trick, there's more to the story. Here's the primary cost breakdown:\nCompute Units (RPUs): You're charged per second for used compute capacity. This is fantastic for burst workloads, but beware of idle charges. Even when your warehouse is inactive, the base capacity incurs costs. It's with a 60-second minimum charge, even just one query is executed in a second in the charge period. Storage: Redshift Managed Storage (RMS) charges apply to the data you store, regardless of serverless or provisioned clusters. Data Transfer: Cross-region data sharing or accessing data from other AWS services like S3, Glue, etc outside the region attract data transfer charges. By breaking down the cost of Redshift serverless, the RPUs usage majorly impacts the cost. Let's see a few examples of how to analyze the cost of your Redshift serverless.\nRedshift serverless uses SYS_SERVERLESS_USAGE to view details of Amazon Redshift serverless usage of resources. After selecting some rows from the tables, it looks like below,\nstart_time end_time compute_seconds compute_capacity data_storage cross_region_transferred_data charged_seconds 2024-02-24 16:34:00 2024-02-24 16:35:00 62 8 31224 0 480 2024-02-24 16:33:00 2024-02-24 16:34:00 48 8 31218 0 0 2024-02-24 16:30:00 2024-02-24 16:31:00 0 0 31218 0 480 2024-02-24 16:29:00 2024-02-24 16:30:00 13 8 31217 0 0 2024-02-24 16:28:00 2024-02-24 16:29:00 0 0 31217 0 480 2024-02-24 16:27:00 2024-02-24 16:28:00 29 8 31210 0 480 From the above records, we know the Redshift serverless is configured with 8 RPUs (minimum RPUs). Every minute for the active Redshift serverless, 480 seconds (60 * 8 RPUs) are charged for the compute units of the Redshift serverless, though the actual usage of compute-seconds is small!\nYou can use the below query to view the percentage of actual computed seconds for your queries in the charged seconds.\n1-- query actual compute usage vs charged usage per day for Redshift Serverless running in us-west-2 2select 3 DATE_TRUNC(\u0026#39;day\u0026#39;, start_time) AS query_day, 4 sum(compute_seconds) as used_compute_seconds, sum(charged_seconds) as charged_seconds, 2/3 as utility_percentage, 5 sum(charged_seconds)*0.360/3600 as cost 6from sys_serverless_usage where CAST(start_time AS TIMESTAMP) \u0026gt;= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL \u0026#39;7 days\u0026#39; 7GROUP BY 1; If you want to which queries are charged in a specific period, leverage SYS_QUERY_HISTORY to view details of user queries. You could join those two tables to see the relationship like below example,\n1with query_info as ( 2 select 3 start_time, 4 end_time, 5 (\u0026#39;[ user_id: \u0026#39; || user_id || \u0026#39; query_id: \u0026#39; || query_id || \u0026#39; transaction_id: \u0026#39; || transaction_id || \u0026#39; session_id: \u0026#39; || session_id ||\u0026#39; - queries: \u0026#39; || SUBSTRING(btrim(query_text), 1, 100) || \u0026#39; ]\u0026#39;) as per_query_info 6 from sys_query_history where start_time ilike \u0026#39;%2024-02-24%\u0026#39; 7 order by start_time 8) 9select 10 syu.start_time, 11 syu.end_time, 12 compute_capacity, 13 charged_seconds, 14 listagg(per_query_info, \u0026#39;,\u0026#39;) as queries_within 15from sys_serverless_usage syu 16inner join query_info sqh 17on sqh.end_time \u0026lt;= syu.end_time 18and sqh.end_time \u0026gt;= syu.start_time 19group by 1,2,3,4; By analyzing the queries, you can evaluate the performance of Redshift serverless and identify the most expensive queries for optimization.\nUse Cases: Where Serverless Shines Redshift Serverless shines in specific scenarios:\nThe intensive queries in a short period (like massive BI queries in few hours). Ad-hoc analytics: Need to run quick queries on your data without spinning up a cluster? Serverless is perfect. Dev/test environments: Test your data pipeline and queries without managing infrastructure. Unpredictable workloads: For workloads with variable demand, serverless scales automatically, saving you from overprovisioning costs. When to Say No: Serverless Isn't for Everyone While tempting, serverless isn't always the answer. Consider these situations:\nLong-running queries: Serverless charges per second, making it less cost-effective for long-running queries compared to provisioned clusters. For example, streaming ingestion from Kinesis data stream or Kafka. Cost-sensitive workloads: If strict budget control is crucial, the base capacity charge and potential idle costs might outweigh the benefits. Conclusion: Choose Wisely Redshift Serverless offers a powerful, flexible option for specific data warehouse needs. However, understanding its cost structure and ideal use cases is crucial to avoid surprises. Carefully evaluate your workload characteristics and budget constraints before diving in. Remember, the magic of serverless lies in using it wisely!\nBonus Tip: Explore hybrid approaches, combining serverless for ad-hoc queries with provisioned clusters for predictable workloads via data sharing feature.\nI hope this blog post helps you navigate the world of Redshift Serverless!

I had a series of posts using CDK to demonstrate Building serverless web applications with AWS Serverless. Because CDK uses a programming language to model your application, you can encapsulate your library via Constructs, and then reuse it crossing the entire application.\nMeanwhile, you can create your own constructs to encapsulate the compliance requirements to simplify the code. For example, in our solution, I used the construct SolutionFunction to force using the same Node.js version(18.x), architecture(ARM64), Lambda logging configuration(JSON log), environment variables for Powertools Logger and so on crossing all NodejsFunction. In addition, using Aspects and escape hatches to make sure the application meets the compliance requirements.\nLet's deep dive into how to make all Nodejs Lambda functions compliant with the above requirements.\nFirstly, define the SolutionFunction for making a generic configuration of solutions's Nodejs Lambda,\n1export class SolutionNodejsFunction extends NodejsFunction { 2 3 constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: NodejsFunctionProps) { 4 super(scope, id, { 5 ...props, 6 bundling: props?.bundling ? { 7 ...props.bundling, 8 externalModules: props.bundling.externalModules?.filter(p =\u0026gt; p === \u0026#39;@aws-sdk/*\u0026#39;) ?? [], 9 } : { 10 externalModules: [], 11 }, 12 runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_18_X, 13 architecture: Architecture.ARM_64, 14 environment: { 15 ...POWERTOOLS_ENVS, 16 ...(props?.environment ?? {}), 17 }, 18 logRetention: props?.logRetention ?? RetentionDays.ONE_MONTH, 19 logFormat: \u0026#39;JSON\u0026#39;, 20 applicationLogLevel: props?.applicationLogLevel ?? \u0026#39;INFO\u0026#39;, 21 }); 22 } 23} Then, add an Aspect to the application to make sure the NodejsFunction functions are an instance of SolutionFunction.\n1class NodejsFunctionSanityAspect implements IAspect { 2 3 public visit(node: IConstruct): void { 4 if (node instanceof NodejsFunction) { 5 if (!(node instanceof SolutionNodejsFunction)) { 6 Annotations.of(node).addError(\u0026#39;Directly using NodejsFunction is not allowed in the solution. Use SolutionNodejsFunction instead.\u0026#39;); 7 } 8 if (node.runtime != Runtime.NODEJS_18_X) { 9 Annotations.of(node).addError(\u0026#39;You must use Nodejs 18.x runtime for Lambda with javascript in this solution.\u0026#39;); 10 } 11 } 12 } 13} 14Aspects.of(app).add(new NodejsFunctionSanityAspect()); The above code snippets help us to archive the compliance of Nodejs Lambda functions without modifying tens or hundreds of occurrences one by one.\nHowever, due to service availability, the ARM64 architect and JSON log Lambda function are not available in the AWS China partition. Also, using another Aspect with escape hatches to override the attributes with conditional values.\n1class CNLambdaFunctionAspect implements IAspect { 2 3 private conditionCache: { [key: string]: CfnCondition } = {}; 4 5 public visit(node: IConstruct): void { 6 if (node instanceof Function) { 7 const func = node.node.defaultChild as CfnFunction; 8 if (func.loggingConfig) { 9 func.addPropertyOverride(\u0026#39;LoggingConfig\u0026#39;, 10 Fn.conditionIf(this.awsChinaCondition(Stack.of(node)).logicalId, 11 Fn.ref(\u0026#39;AWS::NoValue\u0026#39;), { 12 LogFormat: (func.loggingConfig as CfnFunction.LoggingConfigProperty).logFormat, 13 ApplicationLogLevel: (func.loggingConfig as CfnFunction.LoggingConfigProperty).applicationLogLevel, 14 LogGroup: (func.loggingConfig as CfnFunction.LoggingConfigProperty).logGroup, 15 SystemLogLevel: (func.loggingConfig as CfnFunction.LoggingConfigProperty).systemLogLevel, 16 })); 17 } 18 if (func.architectures \u0026amp;\u0026amp; func.architectures[0] == Architecture.arm64) { 19 func.addPropertyOverride(\u0026#39;Architectures\u0026#39;, 20 Fn.conditionIf(this.awsChinaCondition(Stack.of(node)).logicalId, 21 Fn.ref(\u0026#39;AWS::NoValue\u0026#39;), func.architectures)); 22 } 23 } 24 } 25 26 private awsChinaCondition(stack: Stack): CfnCondition { 27 const conditionName = \u0026#39;AWSCNCondition\u0026#39;; 28 // Check if the resource already exists 29 const existingResource = this.conditionCache[stack.artifactId]; 30 31 if (existingResource) { 32 return existingResource; 33 } else { 34 const awsCNCondition = new CfnCondition(stack, conditionName, { 35 expression: Fn.conditionEquals(\u0026#39;aws-cn\u0026#39;, stack.partition), 36 }); 37 this.conditionCache[stack.artifactId] = awsCNCondition; 38 return awsCNCondition; 39 } 40 } 41} 42Aspects.of(app).add(new CNLambdaFunctionAspect()); Alright, using the above two aspects forces the solution to meet the compliance requirements of Lambda functions with the same runtime version, architecture, and logger configuration. \u0026#x1f929; \u0026#x1f604; \u0026#x1f929;\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2024/custom-compliance-for-aws-cdk/","section":"posts","tags":["AWS","AWS CDK","AWS Lambda","Tips"],"title":"Custom compliance implementation in AWS CDK"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/tips/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tips"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/amazon-codewhisperer/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Amazon CodeWhisperer"},{"body":" Disclaimer: the cover image was generated by Amazon Bedrock's Titan Image Generator G1.\nAWS CLI is a swiss knife for orchestrating the operations of AWS resources.

Also, you want to benefit from Serverless technologies for stability, scalability, cost optimization, and operation excellence.\nAWS Lambda Web Adapter is a tool that perfectly meets your expectations. It lifts and shifts the web application based on your preferred language and web framework, including FastAPI, Flask, Django, Express.js, Next.js, Spring Boot, Nginx, PHP, Rust, Golang Gin, Laravel, ASP.NET, and so on! You don't have to change any code to migrate your application to Lambda runtime. It also supports WebSocket and streaming features that work well with your LLM applications.\nAnother use case is that you can orchestrate your cloud infrastructure to support different network topologies without changing any code. Assuming you are ISV, your customers want to deploy your services as both public service and private service. With lambda web adapter, you can share the source code of the service, just orchestrating the AWS services to meet the requirements.\nPublic service pattern: CloudFront + S3 + API Gateway + Lambda You can use CloudFront to publish your entire web service. Using S3 to host all static content of your site and API Gateway with Lambda integration serves as the backend API.\nThe pattern architect for hosting web application as public service Private service pattern: Application Load Balancer (ALB) + Lambda With lambda web adapter, you can deploy your web application with Amazon VPC without exposing it to the internet. In this pattern, we choose ALB as the gateway of network traffic, then forward the different requests to two Lambda functions running web frontend and backend correspondingly.\nThe pattern architect for hosting web application as private service without public access In Clickstream Analytics on AWS solution it applies the above patterns to deploy its web console for different network topologies without changing the code of the web application.

The developers can use console, CLI, API or IaC code(for example, Terraform/CloudFormation/CDK) to provisioning the API resources on AWS. However some developers might flavor with using OpenAPI specification to define the APIs. It enables multiple services/tools to understand the APIs' specification, such as Postman. Amazon API Gateway supports this use case, you can import the existing OpenAPI definition as API.\nAmazon API Gateway offers two RESTful API products, REST API and HTTP API. Both of those two APIs support importing OpenAPI definition, but they might use different OpenAPI extensions to support different features.\nAnd below example will use infrastructure as code(AWS CDK) to import the OpenAPI definition to the API Gateway APIs. While importing OpenAPI definition, the most challenge is updating the OpenAPI definition with dynamic resources information(for example, IAM role for calling downstream resources of integration) before importing the OpenAPI definition. For AWS CDK(on top of AWS CloudFormation) uses the intrinsic functions of CloudFormation(Fn::Join) to archive it.\nREST API 1 const deployOptions = { 2 stageName: \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, 3 loggingLevel: MethodLoggingLevel.ERROR, 4 dataTraceEnabled: false, 5 metricsEnabled: true, 6 tracingEnabled: false, 7 }; 8 const restOpenAPISpec = this.resolve(Mustache.render( 9 fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, \u0026#39;./rest-sqs.yaml\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;utf-8\u0026#39;), 10 variables)); 11 new SpecRestApi(this, \u0026#39;rest-to-sqs\u0026#39;, { 12 apiDefinition: ApiDefinition.fromInline(restOpenAPISpec), 13 endpointExportName: \u0026#39;APIEndpoint\u0026#39;, 14 deployOptions, 15 }); HTTP API But above solution does not work with HTTP API, because the CloudFormation of HTTP API does not support intrinsic functions of CFN. \u0026#x1f625; The workaround is putting the OpenAPI definition to Amazon S3 firstly, then import it from S3 bucket via CloudFormation. It involves putting the OpenAPI definition with dynamic resource information to S3 bucket before importing the OpenAPI definition from S3. Here I leveage the CDK built-in custom resource to call S3 API to put the OpenAPI definition file to S3.\n22/11/09 UPDATE: The Body of AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api only supports the json object. It works after converting the Yaml OpenAPI definition to JSON!\n1const yaml = require(\u0026#39;js-yaml\u0026#39;); 2 3... 4 5 // import openapi as http api 6 const variables = { 7 integrationRoleArn: apiRole.roleArn, 8 queueName: bufferQueue.queueName, 9 queueUrl: bufferQueue.queueUrl, 10 }; 11 const openAPISpec = this.resolve(yaml.load(Mustache.render( 12 fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, \u0026#39;./http-sqs.yaml\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;utf-8\u0026#39;), variables))); 13 14 const httpApi = new CfnApi(this, \u0026#39;http-api-to-sqs\u0026#39;, { 15 body: openAPISpec, 16 failOnWarnings: false, 17 }); The example code creates both REST API and HTTP API, both of them forwards the events to Amazon SQS queue that are sent by HTTP POST requests.

So, building the application supports the federated OIDC login to address such requirements.\nThis post extends the capability of Todolist application protected by Amazon Cognito, using Auth0 as the third party OpenID Connect provider introduces the external user pool.\nThe application also uses the AWS Amplify to build the frontend capabilities(for example, authentication, invoke backend restful api), Amazon Cognito providing both federated OIDC login and self-managed users sign in/sign up, and Amazon API Gateway providing the backend API and validating the token with OIDC provider.\nBelow is the key procedures to add the federated OIDC login to the existing web application protected by Cognito,\n1. Update the authorizer of API Gateway to validate the token issued by OIDC providers.\nThe previous authorizer is using API Gateway Cognito authorizer, it only can validate the token issued by Cognito user pool. Cognito user pool also complies with the OIDC standard, using Lambda authorizer can implement to validate the tokens issued by either Cognito user pool and third party OIDC provider.\nThe CDK code creates a lambda function as Lambda Authorizer of API Gateway, which sets the supported OIDC issuers as environment,\n1 const authFunc = new NodejsFunction(this, `${resourceName}AuthFunc`, { 2 entry: path.join(__dirname, \u0026#39;./lambda.d/authorizer/index.ts\u0026#39;), 3 handler: \u0026#39;handler\u0026#39;, 4 architecture: Architecture.ARM_64, 5 timeout: Duration.seconds(5), 6 memorySize: 128, 7 runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_16_X, 8 tracing: Tracing.ACTIVE, 9 environment: { 10 ISSUERS: issuers, 11 RESOURCE_PREFIX: Arn.format({ 12 service: \u0026#39;execute-api\u0026#39;, 13 resource: api.restApiId, 14 }, Stack.of(this)), 15 }, 16 }); The custom lambda authorizer uses the Auth0's jwt-decode and AWS JWT Verify to verify the ID tokens issued by OIDC provider. See source for detail implementation.\n2. Add the third party OIDC provider to Cognito user pool. It involves the client information with secrets generated by OIDC provider, we use the AWS Secrets Manager to securely store the credentials.\nAs prerequisites of this step, you must create an application in your OIDC provider. For example, creating an application in Auth0, then configure the allowed callback URLs to the pool domain. The next saving the issuer domain, client id, client secret and name(will be readable string in UI) to a secret in Secrets Manager. Todolist app in Auth0 The code snippet of CDK creates the external OIDC provider looks like below,\n1 const oidcSecretArn = this.node.tryGetContext(\u0026#39;OIDCSerectArn\u0026#39;); 2 var oidcProvider: UserPoolIdentityProviderOidc | undefined; 3 if (oidcSecretArn) { 4 const secret = Secret.fromSecretAttributes(this, \u0026#39;OIDCSecret\u0026#39;, { 5 secretCompleteArn: oidcSecretArn, 6 }); 7 oidcProvider = new UserPoolIdentityProviderOidc(this, \u0026#39;FedarationOIDC\u0026#39;, { 8 clientId: secret.secretValueFromJson(\u0026#39;clientId\u0026#39;).toString(), 9 clientSecret: secret.secretValueFromJson(\u0026#39;clientSecret\u0026#39;).toString(), 10 issuerUrl: secret.secretValueFromJson(\u0026#39;issuerUrl\u0026#39;).toString(), 11 name: secret.secretValueFromJson(\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;).toString(), 12 userPool: userpool, 13 scopes: [ 14 \u0026#39;profile\u0026#39;, 15 \u0026#39;openid\u0026#39;, 16 \u0026#39;email\u0026#39;, 17 ], 18 }); 19 userpool.registerIdentityProvider(oidcProvider); 20 } 3.

可以安全的将加密后的Kubernetes Manifest文件提交到Git代码仓库，由Sealed Secrets发现这些SealedSecret的密码， 并解密后动态的创建K8S原生Secrets对象。\nSealedSecret 解决了如何在 Git 代码仓库中安全的保存密钥的痛点，但是该方式仍然需要系统管理员自行的妥善保存 SealedSecret 使用的私钥，以及如何从灾难中恢复的场景。此外，整个密钥的生命周期管理在K8S集群内部， 无法让集群外的工作负载安全有效的使用这些密钥，例如，云厂商上托管的 RDS 类型数据库。\n使用外部密钥服务管理K8S密钥 在 CNCF 基金会在2021年做的一份关于密钥管理的技术雷达报告上指出， AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault 被列为成熟的密钥管理服务或方案。 如果可以在 Kubernetes 中使用这些成熟的密钥服务或方案来管理密钥将可以同时获得密钥服务安全功能强大和 Kubernetes 任务编排的多重收益。\n图1：CNCF End User Technology Radar, Secret Management, February 2021 External Secrets Operator(ESO) 针对以上不足之处，接下来介绍的 External Secrets Operator 将按这个思路解决这些问题。\nExternal Secrets Operator 是一个 Kubernetes Operator，它集成了外部密钥管理系统， 例如 AWS Secrets Manager、HashiCorp Vault、Google Secrets Manager、Azure Key Vault 等等。 他使用外部密钥管理服务的 API 读取信息并自动将值注入 Kubernetes Secret。\n以上是 External Secrets Operator 的简介，看了以后是不是觉得特别眼熟。他跟同时 CNCF 下另一个 DNS 解析服务External DNS非常的类似，为 Kubernetes 内的域名解析注册提供统一的实现体验， 同其他众多第三方成熟的 DNS 解析集成。\n下面将介绍如何在使用 FluxCD 管理 External Secrets Operator，以及在 EKS 中使用 AWS Secrets Manager 管理的密钥。\nFluxCD 部署 External Secrets Operator External Secrets Operator 支持使用 Helm 安装，Flux 部署 ESO 同安装其他 Helm Chart 类似。\n加入 ESO 的 Helm 仓库

创建配置 IRSA EKS 通过IRSA将 K8S 内 RBAC 的 ServiceAccount 同 IAM role 统一在一起， 可以让K8S内的工作负载通过原生的 ServiceAccount 绑定 IAM Role，无需显示的指定 AccessKey/Secret 来访问 AWS API。\n因为 ESO 必须通过 AWS API 访问读取保存在 AWS Secrets Manager 中的密钥。所以需要为 ESO 配置 AWS 访问密钥或使用 IRSA 支持。\n根据 ESO 文档建议的 AWS Secrets Manager 权限创建 IAM Policy 1{ 2 \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, 3 \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ 4 { 5

creationPolicy: Owner 14 deletionPolicy: Delete 15 data: 16 - secretKey: address 17 remoteRef: 18 key: dev/slackurl 如上的 ExternalSecret 对象声明了在 kube-system 命令空间创建名为 slack-url 的密钥。ESO会通过名为 secretstore 的 ClusterSecretStore 对象获取 AWS Secrets Manager 访问凭证，将名为 dev/slackurl 的 AWS Secrets Manager 密钥内容设置到 K8S Secret slack-url 的 address 键值。\n确保 FluxCD 创建 ESO 资源的顺序 如上部署通过 Helm 部署了 ESO，通过 ESO 自定义资源创建了 ClusterSecretStore 和 ExternalSecret 创建密钥。 这些资源通过不同的 Flux 控制器(Kustomization或Helm)所创建，这些资源可用的顺序没有办法保证先后顺序。但是 ESO 的自定义资源对象声明（如ClusterSecretStore）依赖 ESO 完整的部署创建自定义资源声明。这里通过嵌套的 Flux Kustomization 对象来管理不同对象间的依赖。示例实现如下，\n1apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2 2kind: Kustomization 3metadata: 4 name: secrets 5 namespace: flux-system 6spec: 7 interval: 10m0s 8 path:

文档也详细解释了 FluxCD 中的这个问题，并且示例了解决方法。\n小结 本文介绍了 External Secrets Operator 将成熟且经过验证的密钥管理服务（如 AWS Secrets Manager）引入到 Kubernetes 原生生态。 用户可以保留使用这些密钥服务的最佳实践和经验，同时让 K8S 编排的任务也无需改动仍然使用云原生的方式访问密钥。 整个方案兼容了安全成熟的密钥管理同 K8S 内程序访问密钥的需求。\n随后简短的示例了如何在 EKS 环境最佳实践的管理 ESO 部署，同时示例了如何使用 FluxCD GitOps 方式同时管理 ESO 部署和外部密钥。 完整的代码示例可以这个仓库获取。\n如果用户有需求通过文件访问 AWS Secrets Manager 的密钥，可以使用 AWS 开源的 AWS Secrets Manager

而Crossplane提供了一个高度可扩展的后端，使用声明式程序同时编排应用程序和基础设施，不用关心它们在哪里运行。\n近期 AWS 官方博客宣布了 AWS Blueprints for Crossplane，为客户提供了在 Amazon EKS 上应用 Crossplane 的参考实现。\nAWS Blueprints for Crossplane AWS Blueprints for Crossplane 是一个 Github 上开源项目，它提供了如下参考架构及功能，\n✅ 使用Terraform 创建 Amazon EKS 集群并部署Crossplane ✅ 使用eksctl 创建 Amazon EKS 集群并部署Crossplane ✅ AWS Provider- Crossplane Compositions for AWS Services ✅ Terrajet AWS

Crossplane，演示将沿用 Flux 实战 所使用的示例repo。\n手动部署 Crossplane 按照 Crossplane 部署文档，Crossplane 在 EKS 上的部署分为下面三步，\n通过 Helm 部署 Crossplane chart 由于 Crossplane 大量通过 CRD 使用扩展性，需要在 Crossplane 组件部署成功后， 通过 Crossplane pkg CRD 部署及配置对应的 Provider，如在 AWS 上管理 AWS Provider 或 Terrajet AWS Provider AWS Provider 或 Terrajet AWS Provider 是通过 pkg CRD 异步部署的，需要等 Provider CRD 可用后，才可部署对应的 Provider Config 通过 Flux 实现 GitOps 部署

对外部系统中资源的表示，例如，最常见的是云提供商。如下资源申明由 AWS Provider 支持，创建 AWS 上的 RDS 数据库实例。 1apiVersion: database.aws.crossplane.io/v1beta1 2kind: RDSInstance Crossplane 复合资源 (XR)是由托管资源组成的封装的 Kubernetes 自定义资源。 复合资源旨在让用户使用自己的观点和 API 构建自己的平台，而无需从头开始编写 Kubernetes 控制器。 相反，用户定义的 XR 架构教会 Crossplane 当有使用用户定义的 XR 时它应该组成（即创建）哪些托管资源。 AWS Blueprints for Crossplane 提供了 Compositions 示例，涵盖了 VPC，S3，IAM，RDS，DynamoDB，EKS 等服务。 如前面介绍 Crossplane Compositions(XRs) 是对基础设施的模式封装和组合，并不会直接创建云原生资源。\nAWS Blueprints for Crossplane 同时提供了 Examples 示例 直接使用 AWS Provider 提供的托管资源 (MR) 和示例的复合资源 (XR)，如上Compositions中示例VPC，S3, DynamoDB等AWS资源。\n小结及展望 Crossplane 目前是 CNCF 基金会下孵化中项目，一定程度可以实现云上基础设施资源和 Kubernetes 内资源统一使用声明式方式管理。 复合资源 (Composite Resources) 支持了对业务需求的高层次抽象，理念同 Construct Hub 类似。 基础实施团队可以通过复合资源提供高阶抽象，复用经过验证且符合管理需求的抽象组合，简化下游团队管理资源的复杂度。\nCrossplane 自身利用 K8S CRD 创建管理 Composite Resources，首先需要用户熟悉 CRD 的实现。 XRs 本质是通过声明式方式管理云原生基础设施，同样 AWS CloudFormation 是由 AWS 原生提供的通过声明式方式管理 AWS 上资源。 由于云原生资源的功能复杂性，CloudFormation 面临的编写复杂声明式代码，不易于测试和复用的问题同样在 Crossplane XRs 上存在。 同时面对数量庞大的 AWS 或其他云厂商原生服务资源，需要大量的社区资源来创建管理 AWS 可复用的复合资源模式， 可以预见在相当一段时间内云厂商托管资源覆盖率及高阶的复合资源数量都是该技术被广泛采纳的一个障碍。\n对比 AWS CDK/Pulumi 编程方式管理创建的复用资源和更高阶的抽象， Crossplane 在开发和复用效率上并没有优势。 Crossplane 最大的优势是可通过统一 Kubernetes 声明式方式来管理云上资源和 Kubernetes 集群内资源。 但对用户而言采用 Crossplane 的学习成本和开发复杂度较高，Crossplane 及类似技术可列为持续评估调用中，小量谨慎用于生产环境。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/gitops/crossplane-meets-gitops/","section":"posts","tags":["Crossplane","Flux","GitOps","Kubernetes","Git","EKS","CD","Continuous

great abstract to accelerate managing the cloud infrastructure as code. The journey will be enjoyful with leveraging the Construct Hub to use the high level contributions from AWS partners and commnunity.\nUse Case AWS CloudFormation is one of the underly technologies of AWS CDK to manage the cloud infrastructure. It easily to enable the IT administrators even business operators whom has no/limited developer skills to develop the end-to-end solutions with one-click user experience.\nSo it's a use case for effectively developing the Cloud Application via AWS CDK, then publishing it as CloudFormation template with better user experimental experience.\ncdk synth command CDK has a built-in capability to synthesize its application to CloudFormation templates, as known as the cdk synth command. You can upload the syntheized output templates to Amazon S3 bucket, then deploy it via AWS CloudFormation. Looks like it's quite easy to publish the CDK application as CloudFormation templates.\nWhy cdk synth does not work However above procedure is not working in most case while orchestrating a large application in cloud. Due to the CDK applications probably contains assets which need be uploaded to S3 and ECR before deploying the application. For example, a CDK application with using Node.js Function, Python Function, S3 Deployment, Docker Image Assets and so on will be synthesized to the templates that are not deployable directly. It requires to publish those assets(both S3 and ECR assets) firstly, then deploy the templates with parameters pointing to the assets. This step is difficult to be completed manually, because the assets are named with its content hash are not readable by human being in CDK V1. CDK v2 uses the modern bootstrapping template which uses deterministic name for resources to remove the parameters, but it still depends on the assets published priorly before deploying the CloudFormation template.\ncdk-assets command Hence there is another experimental tool provided with CDK project, it's cdk-assets. cdk-assets command use the outputs of cdk synth, then publish the assets of application to S3 and ECR, and update the templates to refer to the assets in S3 and ECR. Looks like the utility perfectly fits the requirement of my use case.\ncdk-assets drawbacks But it still has some drawbacks for this solution. For some AWS services, the assets are mandatorily required from same region. It means that the Lambda code packages(reside on S3) must be from same region S3 bucket, the container images(reside on ECR) must be from same region of SageMaker training job / inference endpoint. For the applications with multiple regions support, we have to replicate above procedure in multiple times and provide multiple CloudFormation links per region like below. It means the users can not switch to another region via region selector after opening one of the links.\nCloudFormation link per region the solution cdk-bootstrapless-synthesizer There is another commnuity tool cdk-bootstrapless-synthesizer to resolve above painful perfectly. It can help synthesize a single CloudFormation template entrypoint, then deploy it to any supported regions. Also it provides a pipeline example(based on AWS CodePipeline) to publish a CDK application to CloudFormation template with multiple regions supported.\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2022/publish-cdk-app-via-cloudformation/","section":"posts","tags":["AWS CDK","AWS CloudFormation","AWS","Tip"],"title":"Publish your AWS CDK applications via AWS CloudFormation templates"},{"body":"在上篇介绍基于 CNCF 下的 GitOps 工具 FluxCD v2 实现了管理多账户的 Kubernetes 集群的共享组件，Secrets 使用的最佳实践， GitOps 流水线事件同 IM(Slack) 的集成，以及对 GitOps 代码的 CI 流程。\n本文将围绕如何使用 Flux 的多租户管理最佳实践，打造基于 GitOps 工作流程的共享服务平台， 实现租户(业务/应用团队)可自助的持续部署。\n一、基于 GitOps 的共享服务平台设定 Kubernetes 提供了命名空间作为一种机制将同一集群中的资源划分为相互隔离的组。 同一个集群中多租户多团队的应用管理将沿用 Kubernetes 内置的各种机制来为不同的租户、团队或应用进行隔离，包括且不限于，\n命名空间(Namespaces) 资源配额(Resource Quotas)，限制应用的资源总量 RBAC 鉴权，限制应用的权限，如可创建 Ingress，不可创建密钥可读取指定名称的密钥，不可创建持久卷等 网络策略(Network Policies) 基于 Kubernetes 以上能力，为基于 GitOps 的共享服务平台设定如下，\n平台团队通过一个 Git 仓库来管理多个跨网络跨账户跨云平台的 Kubernetes 集群，平台团队通过 GitOps 管理如下资源， GitOps Toolkit 组件，如 Flux 集群共享组件，如 CNI, CSI Driver, Ingress Class，Service Accounts, CRD, DNS 等 可观测性的共享组件，如 Log, Metrics, Trace 每个租户/团队/应用的基础资源，如 Namespaces, Resource Quotas, Open Policy，Service Accounts，密钥等 为集群中的每个租户/团队/应用使用独立的 Git 仓库来隔离其持续部署，假设有应用名为 app-a， 应用 app-a 相关的资源都将部署在命名空间 app-a 限制应用使用的总资源，如不超过 2 vCPU, 4 GiB 内存 应用团队使用独立的 Git 仓库来管理应用编排，应用团队将负责应用发布到不同 stage 环境的节奏 应用团队可以使用 Kustomization、Helm 部署应用 应用团队无法创建集群相关的组件，如持久卷、CRD 等资源 应用团队无法创建密钥、Service Account等资源，但仅可使用 infra 团队提前为应用创建的这类资源 二、Flux 多租户的安全设置 对于一个使用命名空间在隔离多租户的集群，Flux 提供了选项来禁止跨命令空间的引用， 例如，Flux 的 Kustomization 或 Helm Releases 禁止引用其他命名空间定义的 Source。 同时，启用强制模拟功能，将 Kustomization 或 Helm Releases 资源的部署默认限制到最小来显示的提升部署的安全性。\n遵循以上 Flux 的多租户安全最佳实践，进行如下 Flux Toolkits 配置（./cluster/cluster-dev/kustomization.yaml） 来禁用跨命名空间引用和强制模拟限制 Kustomization 和 Helm 部署的默认权限，\n1apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 2kind: Kustomization 3resources: 4 -

Kubernetes 集群安装配置 Flux Github repo 为例，执行以下命令，\n1export GITHUB_TOKEN=\u0026lt;your-token\u0026gt; 2 3flux bootstrap github \\ 4 --components-extra=image-reflector-controller,image-automation-controller \\ 5 --owner=zxkane \\ 6 --repository=eks-gitops \\ 7 --path=clusters/cluster-dev \\ 8 --personal 重要 请确保 Flux CLI 执行环境可以通过 kubectl 连接到 Kubernetes 集群，且用户具备 admin 权限。\n重要 创建的 Github Personal Accesss Token 需要至少同时选中全部 repo 和 user 的权限。\n注意 如需在 DEV 环境 启用镜像自动更新功能，bootstrap Flux 时需要加上 --components-extra=image-reflector-controller,image-automation-controller 参数。\n通过类似的步骤在 STAGING 和 PRODUCT 集群安装配置 Flux 。\n1export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/config-cluster-staging 2flux bootstrap github \\ 3 --owner=zxkane \\ 4 --repository=eks-gitops \\ 5 --path=clusters/cluster-staging \\ 6 --personal 7 8export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/config-cluster-product 9flux bootstrap github \\ 10 --owner=zxkane \\ 11 --repository=eks-gitops \\ 12 --path=clusters/cluster-product \\ 13 --personal 以上步骤是手动安装及配置 Flux ，Flux 也支持同现有的 IaC 代码集成，如 eksctl, Terraform。\n最佳实践 上面示例对多环境集群的支持并没有采用多仓库/多分支的策略，而是用的使用不同路径来管理不同的集群。 这也是 Flux 推荐的策略，可以减少代码维护和合并的难度。\n1./clusters/ 2├── cluster-dev [集群名称] 3│ ├── flux-system [命名空间] 4│ ├── gotk-components.yaml [默认 Flux 配置，请勿手动修改] 5│ ├── gotk-sync.yaml [默认 Flux 配置，请勿手动修改] 6│ └── kustomize.yaml [Kustomize 配置入口文件，将通过此入口聚合了集群的全部配置] 7├── cluster-product 8│ ├── flux-system 9│ ├── gotk-components.yaml 10│ ├── gotk-sync.yaml 11│ └── kustomize.yaml 12├── cluster-staging 13│ ├── flux-system 14│ ├── gotk-components.yaml 15│ ├── gotk-sync.yaml 16│ └── kustomize.yaml 在完成初始化不同的环境集群后，将在我们的Git仓库中查看到如上目录结构。 我们可以看到 Flux 自身的配置也是通过 GitOps 的方式来管理的。\n2. 管理集群共享的组件 在企业中通常会由 Infrastructure 团队统一管理集群的共享组件，例如，Namespace, CSI Driver, Ingress Class, Persist Volume, Service Account, Secret, DaemonSet, NetworkPolicy，CustomResource 等等 Kubernetes 对象。 接下来将演示如何在多集群中创建集群内共享组件，例如，AWS Load Balancer Controller 和 External DNS， 并且逐步将这些组件部署在不同的环境中。\nFlux 自身大量依赖了 Kustomize，通过 Flux 的 Kustomize Controller 来渲染最终的 Kubernetes 声明式配置，并集成了 Hook，ServiceAccount，超时等额外配置。\n通过如下Flux Kustomize对象声明为DEV环境声明了共享 Infrastructure 配置所在的路径（该配置文件放置在cluster/cluster-dev目录下），\n1apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2 2kind: Kustomization 3metadata: 4 name: infrastructure 5 namespace: flux-system 6spec: 7 interval: 10m0s 8 path: ./infrastructure/overlays/development 9 prune: true 10 sourceRef: 11 kind: GitRepository 12 name: flux-system 以 External DNS(一个 CNCF 基金会项目，为 K8S Service LoadBalancer / Ingress 对象提供 DNS 域名解析注册) 为完整示例。\n使用 Flux 的 Helm Repositories 自定义对象，注册 bitnami 的 Helm Charts 仓库。\n1apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1 2kind: HelmRepository 3metadata: 4 name: bitnami 5spec: 6 interval: 30m 7 url: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami 按照 External DNS for Amazon Route 53 的文档为 external-dns POD 创建执行 IAM 角色， 可以通过 Route 53 API 来创建修改相应的域名解析。针对 External DNS 部署的在 K8S 集群配置如下，\n为 External DNS 创建独立的 service account，同对应的 AWS IAM Role 绑定，限制该 Pod 仅拥有必需的最小权限。 关于 EKS 上如何绑定最小 AWS 权限到 pod 上请参考IAM roles for service accounts。 1apiVersion: v1 2kind: ServiceAccount 3metadata: 4 name: external-dns 5 annotations: 6 # create IAM role via following docs, 7 # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/specify-service-account-role.html 8 # https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/aws.md#iam-permissions 9 # the role specified by kustomize 10 # eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/external-dns-role 11 eks.amazonaws.com/sts-regional-endpoints: true 定义 HelmRelease Flux 对象 从 Bitnami 的 Helm Charts 仓库安装 external-dns 。 1apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1 2kind: HelmRelease 3metadata: 4 name: external-dns 5spec: 6 releaseName: external-dns 7 targetNamespace: kube-system 8 chart: 9 spec: 10 chart: external-dns 11 version: \u0026#39;\u0026gt;=6.2.1 \u0026lt;7\u0026#39;

GitOps 代码的 CI GitOps 模式带来的又一个好处是可以使用企业成熟且惯用的代码管理工作流来自动化验证变更及代码审核审批。 针对 GitOps 代码可以引入如下 CI 步骤，\n由于 Flux 大量使用 Kustomize 来生成最终的声明式配置，可以实现在每次提交 Pull Request/Merge Request 后的验证阶段引入 kustomize CLI 验证 GitOps 配置是否可以正确的被生成。同时，使用 Flux OpenAPI 结合 kubeconform 验证 Kubernetes 内置资源和 Flux CRD 类型是否配置正确。 借助 KIND(Kubernetes in Docker) 实现完整的端到端测试。KIND 实现了 Docker 容器打包的 Kubernetes 环境， 可以每次 PR 验证阶段启动新的 KIND 环境且安装 Flux 后，执行 GitOps 代码的 reconciliation， 验证 GitOps 代码配置的资源是否可以被创建且状态为READY。 借助 Git 服务的 CI 能力，如 Github Actions, Gitlab CI/CD 等， 实现 GitOps 代码的上述两种自动化检查，以及同代码审核审批集成。 查阅此 Github Actions workflow 配置实现在 KIND 环境 End-To-End 验证 GitOps 配置，和 声明式配置 Manifests 验证。\n最佳实践 利用 Github Actions 或 Gitlab CI/CD 非常容易的将 GitOps 代码集成到 CI 环境， 通过 KIND/Kubeconform 验证代码的正确性。\n6. 小结 本文介绍使用 GitOps 工具 FluxCD v2 实现了管理多账户多 VPC 环境下的 Kubernetes 集群的共享组件，实践了 Secrets 使用的最佳实践， CD 部署事件同 IM(Slack) 的集成，最终示例了通过 GitOps 代码的 CI 流程来提高 GitOps 代码的质量，减少部署中断事故。 可在此仓库获取完整的 GitOps 代码。\n下篇将介绍基于 Flux 实现 GitOps 工作模型下的共享服务平台。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/gitops/flux-in-action-1/","section":"posts","tags":["GitOps","Kubernetes","Flux","Git","EKS","CD","Continuous Delivery"],"title":"基于 Flux 的 GitOps 实战（上）"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/argocd/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ArgoCD"},{"body":"今天 Kuberentes 已经成为IT基础设施的重要玩家，容器编排领域的事实标准。写于3年前的文章不要自建 Kuberentes 的观点已经被绝大多数的企业所认可和接受。\n然而同众多企业接触中发现，企业有很高的意愿采用 Kuberentes 管理工作负载，并且已有大量的企业已经将 Kuberentes 用于生产环境。 但如何对多套不同阶段的 Kuberentes 集群来做持续部署，做到高安全性、权限分离、可审计、保证业务团队的敏捷等需求感到困惑。 目前客户实现方式非常多样，并没有很好的遵循业界的最佳实践。\nGitOps 是目前最佳的一种方法来实现基于 Kuberentes 集群的持续部署，且同时满足安全性、权限分离等企业级需求。\n什么是 GitOps GitOps 是一种为云原生应用程序实施持续部署的方法。 它通过使用开发人员已经熟悉的工具，包括 Git 和持续部署工具， 专注于在操作基础架构时以开发人员为中心的体验。\nGitOps 的核心思想包括，\n拥有一个 Git 存储库，该存储库始终包含对生产环境中当前所需基础设施的声明性描述，以及一个使生产环境与存储库中描述的状态相匹配的自动化过程 期望的状态以强制不变性和版本控制的方式存储，并保留完整的版本历史 如果您想部署一个新的应用程序或更新一个现有的应用程序，您只需要更新存储库，软件代理自动从源中提取所需的状态声明，自动化过程会处理其他所有事情 软件代理持续观察实际系统状态并尝试应用所需状态 同传统的持续部署系统对比如下，\n传统 CD 系统 GitOps 系统 由推送事件触发，如代码提交、定时任务、手动等 系统不断轮询变更 仅部署变更的部分 为任何部署声明了整个系统 系统可能会在部署之间漂移 系统将纠正任何漂移 CD 程序必须有权访问部署环境 部署管道在系统范围内被授权运行 GitOps 不会处理如下声明，\n持久化的应用数据，例如来自用户上传 基于 Schema 的部署，例如数据库 schema 即使采用了 GitOps 部署，对于以上数据的备份和恢复同样很重要。\n声明式配置是 Kuberentes 从 Day 1 开始提供支持的， 可以说 Kuberentes 声明式配置很好的匹配了 GitOps 原理中的声明性描述需求。 结合自定义资源定义将声明式配置扩展到了自定义资源，K8S 中的自定义资源也可以 无缝的适配 GitOps 部署方法。\nKuberentes 上 GitOps 最佳实践 GitOps 方法下，Git 成为系统所需状态的唯一事实来源，支持可重复的自动化部署、集群管理和监控。 复用企业中已经非常成熟的 Git 工作流程来完成编译、测试、扫描等持续集成步骤， 当系统最终状态的声明代码进入 Git 仓库主线分支后，依托 GitOps 工具链来完成验证部署，到观测告警， 到操作修复达到系统最终状态的闭环(见图1)。\n图1：GitOps -- 一个持续运维的模型 下面让我们来看看理想中的 Kuberentes 上的 GitOps 最佳实践。\n基于 GitOps 的持续部署 以下是基于 GitOps 的 Kuberentes 部署流程，\n开发者提交应用代码和配置到源代码仓库。 持续集成服务器编译、测试、扫描并且推送新版本的镜像到镜像仓库，同时更新 K8S manifests 到 Git 仓库。 GitOps 代理(如 ArgoCD/Flux) 检测到 Git 仓库变更并自动变动到 K8S 集群。 图2：基于 GitOps 的持续部署型 基于 GitOps 的多集群管理 当 Pull Request 被合并到平台仓库，配置在多集群上的 GitOps 代理将监控这个仓库， 并且部署这些更新到 kube-system 或者平台命名空间。 每个集群有一个集群仓库用于存储配置，例如访问控制、DNS等。同时每个集群通过平台仓库 同上游平台同步。 图3：基于 GitOps 的多集群管理 GitOps 下的应用开发体验 业务团队负责镜像的编译、测试和扫描等。声明配置被提交到业务/应用特定的配置仓库。 GitOps 代理运行在特定的租户命名空间，应用的状态从应用团队的仓库同步到特定的租户命名空间。 图4：GitOps 下的应用开发 支持多租户的集群 同上，不同的业务/应用团队有各自的配置仓库。在集群中，不同的业务/应用由不同的命名空间隔离， 被 GitOps 代理持续部署在各自不同的命名空间中。\n图5：GitOps 多租户支持 使用 Helm 管理应用程序 Helm 是 Kuberentes 生态下的包管理器，类似 Debian 下的 apt。 对 Helm 提供无缝的支持将可以利用到现有成熟的K8S应用打包生态，无论是部署三方组件还是企业已经存在的应用。\n对多环境的部署管理 在企业应用中多套环境、多云、混合云的场景是非常常见的，对应用的部署需要通过基础清单加上各个环境个性化的清单来 简化对多套环境的部署管理。\nKustomize 正是为解决这个问题而创建，并且已经成为 K8S 原生工具链中的一部分。对 Kustomize 提供支持， 将很好的在 GitOps 中满足此类需求。\n图6：GitOps 多环境支持 综上，从持续部署，多集群管理，多租户支持和现有工具链、生态集成方面，描述了对 Kubernetes 上 GitOps 的理想状态。接下来让我们来讨论下现有的 GitOps 工具， 是否可以很好的支持前面描绘的 GitOps 的理想状态。\n云原生的 GitOps 工具 由于 Kubernetes 是 CNCF 基金会的核心项目，整个生态会首先关注 CNCF 基金会下的项目，对 GitOps 来说同样如此。\nCNCF 在2020年发布了 Continuous Delivery 技术雷达，Flux 和 Helm 两个项目被归类为 采用，Kustomize 是被归类为试用，Argo CD 在雷达中为技术评估。\nCNCF 在2021年发布的 Multicluster Management 技术雷达 中的 Core Services and Add-ons 管理雷达，Flux, Kustomize, Argo 和 Helm 等项目都被评为可采用。\n基于前面对 GitOps 的核心定义，CNCF 的技术雷达象限以及社区的对比，目前整个社区中最为 普及的 GitOps 工具是 Argo CD 和 Flux。\nPush 还是 Poll? GitOps 在实践中面临是采用推(push)还是拉(pull)的部署风格选择。\n采用推部署风格会有如下好处，\n简单易理解。这种部署方式已经被众多知名的 CI/CD 工具所采用，例如 Jenkins CI，AWS Code系列。 灵活。易于同其他的脚本或工具集成。拉(pull)风格的 GitOps 代理只能运行在 Kuberentes 中。 采用拉部署风格会有如下好处，\n更加安全。因为 GitOps 代理运行在 Kubernetes 集群中，因此仅需要最小的权限用于部署。简化网络配置不需要该集群同 CD 程序建立网络连接，尤其在管理多集群时尤为简洁。 一致性。管理多集群时，确保了每个集群的管理方式都是一样的。 隔离性。每个集群的部署不依赖于集中的流水线 CD 程序。 可伸缩性。该方式可以容易的扩展到同时管理成百上千的集群。 从以上对比可见，采用拉(pull)的部署风格从安全性、可伸缩性、隔离性、一致性都更优，GitOps 部署方式应该首选拉部署风格。\n主流云原生 GitOps 对比 下表详细对比了 Argo CD / Flux v2，供参考。\nArgoCD Flux v2 安装/配置 一个命令安装，但没有原生的机制实现配置。需要通过 UI 或创建大量清单 一个命令完成安装和配置 部署风格 推(push) / 拉(pull) 拉(pull) 秘钥管理[1] Sealed secrets Sealed secrets / Mozilla SOPS Webhook 接收[2] 支持 支持 告警和通知 内置集成 slack，email，Google Chat 等。 内置集成 slack，discord，MS Teams 等。 镜像更新自动化 支持 支持 Reconciliation 可配置性 有限支持（只能全局设置 reconciliation 时间，不能为每个应用设置不同的 reconciliation 时间。） 支持设置 sync(同步) 和 reconciliation 间隔 应用交付 -- 原生 Kuberentes 清单(YAML) 是的，Argo CD 应用程序的副作用是需要在重试中重新应用资源。 支持，被视同为 kustomization yaml 应用交付 -- Kustomization 支持 支持，还提供 GitOps 组件间的依赖 应用交付 -- Helm charts 支持，但没有使用 Helm Go 语言程序库。 Helm chart 钩子被转为 Argo CD syncwaves/hooks。因此，不支持 Helm cli。 支持，原生支持 chart 钩子，可作为组件相互依赖。支持 Helm cli。 Web UI 支持，提供了完整的 UI 操作。 没有官方 UI 实现。开源平台 Weave GitOps 基于 Flux 提供 UI。 多租户权限管理 支持，实现了独立于 Kubernetes 基于访问控制列表的 RBAC，具有细粒度控制。 是的，它严格基于 Kubernetes 的 RBAC 能力，需要结合其他 CNCF 项目做粒度控制，比如 Kyverno。 多集群管理 -- 多集群管理和部署 支持，对集群做了原生抽象。 支持。理论上支持使用 KubeConfig 设置通过 Kustomziation 和 Helm 在一个 Flux 中管理多个集群上的工作负载。 多集群管理 -- 创建集群 不支持，需要通过第三方工具。例如，CAPI, Crossplane, Open Cluster Management 等。 不支持，需要通过第三方工具。例如，CAPI, Crossplane, Open Cluster Management 等。 GitOps 工具自身的可观测性 通过 Prometheus + Grafana 提供。 通过 Prometheus + Grafana 提供。 通过上表从 GitOps 核心理念来看，无论 ArgoCD 还是 Flux 都满足 GitOps 的理念。且满足了企业级需求，如多租户权限、多集群管理、 秘钥管理、告警通知、支持 Helm 和 Kustomization。从自身的实现上说，ArgoCD 提供了完整的抽象，包括且不限于 Cluster、RBAC、Application、Hook 等。 这样的做法具备了更加广泛的功能集的可能，但同时增加了自身程序的复杂度，也提高了用户的学习门槛。Flux 自身架构更加简洁，默认组件仅有 Source, Kustomize, Helm, Notification, Image automation 这5个组件，尽量复用 Kuberentes 原生能力，例如使用 ServiceAccount 实现多租户的 RBAC 控制， 降低了用户的学习门槛，同云原生社区其他项目的兼容性更强。\n[1]: Git仓库可能公开读且明文保存 Secrets 对象，需要将其加密后再提交到 Git\n[2]: 默认采用 Poll 轮询拉取 Git 仓库变更，提供 Webhook 接口可被 Git 仓库提交事件触发\n小结 本文介绍了什么是 GitOps，Kuberentes 上基于 GitOps 实现持续部署的最佳实践，以及 CNCF 下 GitOps 方向最为流行项目 Argo CD 和 Flux 的对比。后续将以 Flux v2 为实战，深入介绍如何实现 GitOps 持续部署且同时满足各类企业级需求。\n参考资料 GitOps: Cloud-native Continuous Deployment The CNCF End User Technology Radar Continuous Delivery, June 2020 The CNCF End User Technology Radar Multicluster Management, June 2021 Push vs. Pull in GitOps: Is There Really a Difference?

组织将 AWS 账户作为平台，自动化创建，其特点如下，\nAWS 账户属于应用团队且由他们运营 基础设施团队为应用账户提供工具，包括且不限于， 支撑型的基础设施(例如，网络，安全，域名，公司标准等) AWS Proton 环境和应用 AWS Service Catalog 产品 此外 [AWS Control Tower][control-towner], AWS Organizations, CloudFormation StackSets, AWS Config 一致性功能， 都是一些服务或功能可以支持以账户为管理单位的共享平台。\n托管容器集群作为\u0026quot;平台\u0026quot; AWS 账户由平台/基础设施团队运营，他们将管理容器集群的生命周期，例如托管的 EKS(Kubernentes) 集群。应用团队负责将 应用部署到基础设施团队管理的多租户集群，应用团队将承担如下职责(包括且不限于)，\n应用程序持续集成 入口流量控制 访问管理 运营可见性 服务于应用程序的周边基础设施(例如，数据库、队列或缓存等)的部署可以通过持续集成的 AWS CloudFormation/AWS CDK 模板，AWS Proton 环境/应用来实现。\n可部署的应用程序模式作为\u0026quot;平台\u0026quot; 这种模式下通常会由基础设施团队拥有共享账户，负责网络、域名、审计等资源。应用团队负责应用账户。基础设施团队创建现成的 应用程序、部署机制、抽象库供应用程序团队使用或自定义，如下一些服务或功能可以实现该模式，\nAWS Proton AWS CloudFormation / AWS Service Catalog AWS CDK constructs 产品化运营共享自服务平台 共享自服务平台除了根据组织管理和技术栈选择合适的实现模式外，是否能够在一个组织内真正的优化效率，提升研发交付速度取决于 如何运营这个平台。这里我们看到的成功案例都是将该平台产品化，按经营产品的方式来运营他。通常成功的共享自服务平台 分为三个步骤来实现自身价值，形成增长飞轮。\n1. 尝试，证明价值 所谓万事开头难，构建共享服务平台需要找到一个合适的应用团队作为种子用户。该团队的应用场景应该是一个典型用例，应用团队 需要频繁发布来交付业务价值，而该应用将涉及到基础设施团队负责的模块，且要符合组织对安全性和合规性的审查。由双方团队共同 定义交互模型，例如，如何开发基础设施即代码，平台基础架构，应用部署方式。并且应用团队方需要认可该平台的价值，在种子应用 成功落地共享服务平台后，会逐渐将更多应用落地到共享平台模式上。\n同时，平台的技术选项也非常重要，要适应企业自身的组织管理结构和技术栈能力。例如，\nAWS CloudFormation / AWS CDK: 通用且最灵活的实现；同时也是双刃剑，维护大型的 CloudFormation 模板是非常困难的，采用 AWS CDK 需要学习新的技能，且有时需要深入研究才可能 Hack 某些内部实现；是如果需要完全掌握实现细节时的选择， AWS Copilot: 仅适用于 ECS 上部署的容器应用；开发应用的团队不关心或不需要管理基础设施， AWS Proton: 适用于将应用和基础设施权限分离的场景；满足应用团队需要自服务的模式。 2. 复制推广 在满足了种子应用的需求后，让共享服务平台走向成功的关键是如何运营推广他。产品化的运营需要做的以下几点，\n文档化你构建的平台，包括 自服务/自动化的采用步骤 用户手册、API 文档 支持的机制，如何为采用平台的内部用户提供技术支持 公开代码，至少是内部开源，让更多的用户参与共享 内部营销平台 利用成功案例赢得领导们的支持，达到量化平台价值，规避风险，提升业务研发效率 内部\u0026quot;路演\u0026quot;招募团队并获得反馈 证明你的共享服务平台方式可扩展 考虑支持几十上百的团队 可跨越各种场景，例如，应用程序中断，AWS 服务事件，迁移，0-day 补丁 考虑平台复制的瓶颈在哪里？例如，采用难度，学习曲线，部署，支持 / on call 等等 3. 形成飞轮 共享自服务平台最终形成产生自身增长势头的良性循环，例如，\n投资平台团队 --\u0026gt; 添加平台功能 --\u0026gt; 应用开发者更快乐 --\u0026gt; 增加平台使用 --\u0026gt; 提升组织的效率 --\u0026gt; 投资平台团队 --\u0026gt; ...\n通过以上一个飞轮闭环，达成长期成功。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2021/shared-service-platform-for-decentralized-developer-teams/","section":"posts","tags":["SSP","DevOps","GitOps","Infrastructure as Code","AWS","Proton","Service Catalog"],"title":"AWS上构建共享自服务平台服务去中心化研发团队"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/infrastructure-as-code/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Infrastructure as Code"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/proton/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Proton"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/service-catalog/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Service Catalog"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/ssp/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"SSP"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/amazon-builders-library/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Amazon Builders' Library"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/series/amazon-builders-library/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Amazon-Builders-Library"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/resilience-engineering/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Resilience Engineering"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/system-design/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"System Design"},{"body":"AWS架构的完善(AWS Well-Architected)框架涉及了五大支柱， 其中可靠性支柱要求侧重于确保工作负载在预期的时间内正确、一致地执行其预期功能。 这要求应用程序系统具备弹性设计，可从故障中快速恢复，以便满足业务和客户需求。 然而设计、开发、且验证具备弹性设计的应用程序，对经验和实践能力都有很高的要求。 利用成熟的经验和良好的工具将加快构建符合预期的弹性应用程序。\nApplication Resilience Workshop是一套课程和动手实践学习如何进行实验来观察系统的行为， 例如，极端系统负载和网络中断情况下，使用不同的软件模式来减轻这些实验对系统稳态的影响。 整个实验也是分为假设、方法、观测和缓解等步骤，同混沌工程有异曲同工之处。\n应用程序弹性实验假设了一个微服务构建的应用程序，通过压力测试工具注入极端的系统负载， 通过应用程序各服务的可观测性来理解目标应用的延迟，吞吐、容量、RTO等指标。\n当发现最初设计的应用程序在极端压力下会有灾难性的故障，教程中给出了队列，负载卸载， 通过降低服务QoS的Client Deadline Cutoff，断路器，令牌桶等程序设计模式来缓解极端压力对系统造成的灾难性的故障。\n但是无论使用队列解耦还是负载卸载都不是绝对完美的解决方案，在Amazon Builders' Library 中的几篇文章为我们分享了Amazon从运行大规模分布式系统中学习到的宝贵且成熟的经验，\n避免无法克服的队列积压 通过卸除负载来避免过载 超时、重试和抖动回退 利用这些成熟的经验我们可以权衡系统的需求和技术实现，选择当下最合理且可行的解决方案。\n在今年的Pre-re:Invent之际，AWS发布了AWS Resilience Hub服务，将应用程序云上资源状态的扫描， 系统弹性的评估，符合RPO/RTO的配置建议，以及基于混沌工程的实验运行集成为一个整体的服务，通过一个控制面板实现了应用程序弹性的管理。\n此外，如果你的应用刚好是一个电商或在线票务系统，系统正在面对秒杀、黑五等大规模负载压力的考验，可以参考甚至直接尝试AWS解决方案 AWS Virtual Waiting Room来直接构建一个弹性系统。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2021/application-resilience/","section":"posts","tags":["AWS","resilience engineering","Amazon Builders' Library","System Design"],"title":"应用程序弹性设计"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/metaverse/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Metaverse"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/nft/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Nft"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/%E5%85%83%E5%AE%87%E5%AE%99/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"元宇宙"},{"body":"元宇宙是近期的热点话题，近期做了些学习了解，将一些学习内容总结为一个deck。分享如下，\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2021/metaverse/","section":"posts","tags":["metaverse","nft","元宇宙"],"title":"元宇宙风口下的机会"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/aws-fault-injection-simulator/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"AWS Fault Injection Simulator"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/aws-fis/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"AWS FIS"},{"body":"混沌工程是一种帮助系统满足弹性需求的技术，它起源于Netflix的工程实践，著名的猴子军团。\nAWS一直提倡架构的完善(AWS Well-Architected)，混沌工程正是卓越运营和可靠性支柱的实践。 因此在 re:Invent 2020 AWS发布了Fault Injection Simulator服务来简化开发者在AWS上的混动工程实践。\nAWS FIS作为AWS上原生的混沌工程服务，目前已同EC2，ECS，EKS，RDS，CloudWatch，甚至是IAM Role API集成，可以触发这些服务中资源的变更来假设故障， 例如，重启或终止EC2实例，重启RDS实例等。\nChaos Engineering on AWS是一份非常详细的混沌工程在AWS上动手实验。 该实验将指导参与者快速设置实验初始环境，通过可观测性工具了解系统状态，然后带领实验参与者通过详细的实验步骤学习如何使用FIS服务来达到对系统可靠性的验证和优化。 实验项目除了覆盖FIS支持集成的EC2，ECS，RDS等服务外，还演示了SSM集成，并且通过FIS内置的SSM文档或自定义的SSM文档来假设系统故障。 混沌工程作为一种提升系统弹性的质量手段，需要重复性的在系统中实验，动手实验也为参与者设计了CI/CD实验，通过Gitops方式将混动工程持续实验到系统环境中。 总之，对混沌工程有兴趣的开发者，Chaos Engineering on AWS非常值得一做的动手实验，可以快速的帮助您了解混沌工程，及FIS在AWS上的实践。\n最后再强调下最重要的事，混沌工程不是一个孤立的系统弹性实验，它需要系统本身的弹性、可靠性设计以及可观测性的实现，是一个系统整体的设计实践。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2021/chaos-engineering-on-aws/","section":"posts","tags":["AWS","chaos engineering","AWS Fault Injection Simulator","AWS FIS"],"title":"AWS上的混沌工程"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/chaos-engineering/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Chaos Engineering"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/filevault/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Filevault"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/macos-monterey/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"MacOS Monterey"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/macosx/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"MacOSX"},{"body":"I'm trying to upgrade my Macbook Pro to macOS Monterey, however the installation can not be started due to the disk is encrypted by Filevault \u0026#x1f615;

AWS CloudFormation is the managed service offering the IaC capability on AWS since 2011. CloudFormation uses the declarative language to manage your AWS resources with the style what you get is what you declare.\nHowever there are cons of CloudFormation as a declarative language,\nthe readability and maintenance for applications involving lots of resources the reuseable of code, CloudFormation modules released in re:Invent 2020 might help mitigate it AWS CDK provides the programming way to define the infra in code by your preferred programming languages, such as Typescript, Javascript, Python, Java and C#. AWS CDK will synthesis the code to CloudFormation template, then deploying the stack via AWS CloudFormation service.

The EMR cluster might fail on creation due to network issue. It’s caused by the NAT gateway is not ready when initializing the EMR cluster, you have to manually create the dependencies among EMR cluster and NAT gateway.\nAlways override the logical ID of CloudFormation resource when creating AWS resources with unique name UPDATED: 2023/10/24\nWhen creating an AWS resource via CDK with a friendly name, for example, you create a Glue Table named my-table in CDK. The logical ID will be generated by CDK constructs' name inheritance, however, you might refactor your constructs in the system design level. The default logical ID of the resource will be changed after your refactor or renaming the ID of construct. After the logical ID changes, the resource will be replaced when updating the CloudFormation stack to a new template. In the updating process of CloudFormation stack, a new resource will be created firstly, however, the resource creation will fail due to the conflict resource name. Currently, the workaround is that explicitly overriding the logical ID of the AWS resource created by CDK to avoid the replacement in stack updating. Explicitly override the logical ID will maintain the code readability and avoid the unintended the failure of stack update.\n1(table.node.defaultChild as CfnResource).overrideLogicalId(tableLogicId); EKS module(@aws-cdk/aws-eks) specify kubectl layer when creating EKS cluster NOTE: This tricky only applies for AWS CDK prior to 1.81.0.

You have to manage the lifecycle of those resources by yourself.\nFor example, there is an EKS cluster with AWS load balancer controller, then you deploy a helm chart with ingress that will create ALB/NLB by the chart, you must clean those load balancers in deletion of the chart. Also the uninstall of Helm chart is asynchronous, you have to watch the deletion of resource completing before continuing to clean other resources.\nTHE END The tips will be updated when something new is found or the one is deprecated after CDK is updated.\nHAPPY CDK \u0026#x1f606;\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2020/effective-aws-cdk-for-aws-cloudformation/","section":"posts","tags":["Infrastructure as Code","AWS CloudFormation","AWS CDK","AWS"],"title":"Effective AWS CDK for AWS CloudFormation"},{"body":"近期Amazon Builders Library发布了数篇文章介绍亚马逊如何实践持续部署，同时分享了亚马逊在部署方面的最佳实践。\n这里将这三篇文章核心内容做个概述，方便大家按需细读。\nGoing faster with continuous delivery 这篇文章先是分享了亚马逊持续改进和软件自动化的文化(Amazonian随时都惦记着的领导力准则)，然后介绍了亚马逊内部的持续部署工具Pipelines。从一个试点工具进化为亚马逊标准、一致且简洁的发布工具。并且将构建和发布软件的最佳实践检查也融入到Pipelines中。\n接下来是分享如何减小故障影响到客户的风险。有过软件开发经验的都知道，软件变更引入故障是不可避免的，如何将故障对客户的影响控制到最小是非常重要的。该文从下面几个方面给出了建议，\n部署卫生，如对新部署程序的健康检查 上生产系统之前的测试，自动化单元、集成、预生产测试 生产系统上的验证，分批的部署，控制故障影响半径 控制何时发布软件 最后作者介绍了亚马逊如何快速执行业务创新 -- 通过自动化一切事情。\nAutomating safe, hands-off deployments 这篇文章很好的呼应了Going faster with continuous delivery一文中如何避免新的部署导致故障影响，非常详细的介绍了亚马逊关于自动化安全部署的实践。\n对于持续部署，源码 -\u0026gt; 构建 -\u0026gt; 测试 -\u0026gt; 生产 这个流程大家都很熟悉。\n从下图看，亚马逊对于源码和构建的理解是非常深入和全面的。\n源码并不仅仅是应用程序源代码，还可以包括运维工具代码、测试代码、基础架构代码、静态资源、依赖库、配置和操作系统补丁。\n代码审核是必须的。对于全自动的流水线，代码审核是最后一道人工核验。代码审核不仅仅是审核代码的正确性，还应该检查代码是否包括足够的测试，是否有完善的工具来监测部署以及能否安全的回退。\n同时构建也不光是编译源代码，打包并存储构件。也包含单元测试，静态代码分析，代码覆盖率检查，代码审核检查。\n测试在亚马逊是一个多阶段的预生产环境，详见下图。\n集成测试是自动化的模拟客户一样使用服务，实现端到端的测试。部署到生产之前，还需要执行向后兼容性测试以及借助负载均衡实现one-box测试。\nAWS服务是部署在全球多个区域内的多个可用区，为了减少部署故障对客户的影响，生产通过波次部署来分批分阶段的安全部署。\n首先部署是在单区域的单可用区做one-box部署，如果引起负面问题，会自动回退并停止生产后续的部署。系统指标的监控是实现自动化安全部署的核心，需要通过监控的指标来自动触发部署回退。\nBake time也是实践经验总结出来的精髓。有时故障不是在部署后马上显现的，需要时间才会逐渐显现。设置合理的Bake time，能够让故障有足够时间被暴露出来，不至于照成大范围影响。\nEnsuring rollback safety during deployments 因为故障是不可避免的，部署能够被安全回退是非常必要的。这篇文章就详细介绍了如何实现可安全回退的部署 -- 通过两阶段部署的技术，以及序列化的最佳实践。\n这三篇文章分别从术和器的角度分享了亚马逊在软件部署的实践经验，开发者们可以结合自身业务情况集成适合的最佳实践。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2020/the-best-practise-of-deployment-at-amazon/","section":"posts","tags":["DevOps","Continuous Deployment","Amazon Builders' Library","System Design"],"title":"亚马逊的部署最佳实践"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/aws-step-functions/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"AWS Step Functions"},{"body":"AWS CDK是编排部署AWS云上资源最佳的工具之一。基于AWS CDK的应用应该如何实践DevOps持续集成和部署呢？\n通常我们有下面几种方法，\n使用AWS CodePipeline来完成DevOps pipeline搭建。CodePipeline是AWS Code系列服务中的持续集成编排工具，它可以集成CodeBuild项目，在CodeBuild项目build中安装cdk，并执行cdk deploy命令来实现应用部署。 这种方法简单直接的实现了DevOps部署流水线。但缺少staging，将最新提交直接部署到生产是一种非常高风险的做法。\nCDK近期发布了体验性的新特性CDK Pipelines来封装CDK应用持续部署流水线的配置。CDK Pipelines也是基于AWS CodePipeline服务，提供快速创建可跨账号区域的持续部署流水线，同时支持部署流水线项目的自升级更新。整个流水线流程如下图所示， CDK Pipelines是非常高效且灵活的持续部署流水线创建的方式，但由于是体验性特性，在生产应用中还有一些局限性。例如，\n不支持context provider查找。也就是说，无法支持CDK应用查找账户中存在的VPC，R53 HostedZone等。 由于CDK Pipelines实际是使用CodePipeline来编排部署流水线，CodePipeline的局限性，CDK Pipelines同样存在。 CodePipeline在某些分区和区域还不可用。例如，AWS中国区暂时还没有CodePipeline服务，CDK Pipelines在AWS中国区也就无法使用。 使用AWS Step Functions来编排CDK应用部署的流水线。在Step Functions编译的部署流水线中，可用通过CodeBuild项目来完成cdk deploy执行做到完整的支持CDK的所有功能。同时Step Functions具备最大的灵活性来支持持续部署过程中的各种编排需求，例如，跨账户部署应用的不同stage，引入人工审批流程，通过Slack等chatops工具来完成审批。 Opentuna项目就实践了用Step Functions来编排持续部署流水线。整个部署流程如下图，\n如果对基于Step Functions实现的CDK应用持续部署感兴趣，可以访问OpenTUNA项目实现的源码了解更多细节。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2020/deploy-aws-cdk-applications-cross-accounts/","section":"posts","tags":["AWS","AWS CDK","DevOps","AWS Step Functions"],"title":"跨账号跨区域部署AWS CDK编排的应用"},{"body":"Sonatype Nexus repository OSS is an artifact repository that supports most software repositories such as Maven, Pypi, Npmjs, Rubygems, Yum, Apt, Docker registry and etc. In the enterprise Nexus repository is widely used for storing proprietary artifacts and caching the artifacts for speeding up the devops.\nBuilding a production ready Nexus repository always is a requirement for devops team, it should satisfy below criterias at least,\nartifacts storage management It's difficult to predicate the storage usage of artifacts, allocating large volume is not cost optimized. the durability of nexus3 data storage We need a way to make sure data storage of nexus when updating Nexus OSS to newer version or recover the service from unhealthy status. self healing capability when the service is down A reliable way recovers the Nexus repository OSS when it's unhealth.

通常oh-my-zsh中内置或三方社区提供的插件是导致性能降低甚至互相冲突的主要原因。排查思路也很简单，通过逐个禁用已加载的插件来测试是否可以解决问题。\n用文本编辑器打开当前用户的~/.zshrc配置，找到plugins开头的配置行，例如，\n1plugins=( 2 git 3 osx 4## gradle 5 brew 6## command-not-found 7 github 8#

Request的协同工作模式呢？\n答案是，CodeCommit完全可以实现基于Pull Request的代码协作。由于Git的分布式代码管理特性，首先fork上游项目仓库，将修改后的代码提交到fork仓库，通过Pull Request申请修改请求合并。Github将这套协作流程推广开来并被开源项目广泛采用。其实还有另外的Git仓库协同方式来完成多人的协作开发，例如Gerrit Code

Toolkit发布了Cloud Debugging beta功能。该功能支持在IntelliJ IDEs(IntelliJ, PyCharm, Webstorm, 以及 Rider)中远程调试 ECS Fargate 容器中执行的应用程序。\n\b对ECS Fargate demo启用了远程调试并调试成功后，这里记录一下该功能的使用体验并且分享体验过程中掉进去过的一些坑。\n试用体验 首先，该功能不适用于生产环境。因为对ECS Fargate类型的Service启用Cloud Debugging功能会将原始的ECS Services收缩为0个task副本，同时创建一个新的Service并启用新的Task Definition，新的Task Definition中会加入Cloud Debug Sidecar容器来辅助实现远程调试。整个过程会对生产环境造成变更。 如果ECS集群是通过CI/CD持续部署，并且是多人协同使用的环境，该功能也不适用。因为，对某些容器服务启用Cloud Debugging将导致他人的持续部署失败或不生效。 启用Cloud Debugging操作比较麻烦，且启用状态下无法更新ECS中部署的版本。需要先停用Cloud Debugging，部署新版本代码，然后再次启用Cloud Debugging才能调试新代码。尽可能的不要依赖Cloud Debugging来调试程序，花功能做好单元测试，集成测试以及E2E测试来避免调试云端环境。 试用经验 按照官方文档启用Cloud Debugging后，创建Cloud Debugging Launch Configuration并执行调试，遇到**Retrieve execution role finished exceptionally**错误。错误的原因是，文档中没有提到Cloud Debug Sidecar需要logs:CreateLogStream权限创建CloudWatch Logs Stream。解决方案是，为ECS Task Execution Role添加logs:CreateLogStream权限。 在AWS Toolkit Jetbrains当前的版本1.9-193不支持启用了AppMesh或X-Ray的Task。解决方案是，对需要启用Cloud Debugging的Task暂时禁用App Mesh和X-Ray。 Cloud Debugging是一个不错的开发工具尝试思路，帮助开发者更好的做出Cloud Native应用。但是该项目仍然是一个早期项目，有许多问题需要修复和改进。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2019/aws-cloud-debugging/","section":"posts","tags":["AWS","AWS Toolkit","AWS ECS","AWS Fargate","IntelliJ IDEs"],"title":"AWS

Batch是一个全托管的批处理调度服务，它可为用户管理所有基础设施，从而避免了预置、管理、监控和扩展批处理计算作业所带来的复杂性。当然AWS Batch已与 AWS 平台原生集成，让用户能够利用 AWS 的扩展、联网和访问管理功能。让用户轻松运行能够安全地从 AWS 数据存储（如 Amazon S3 和 Amazon DynamoDB）中检索数据并向其中写入数据的作业。AWS Batch可根据所提交的批处理作业的数量和资源要求预置计算资源并优化作业分配。能够将计算资源动态扩展至运行批处理作业所需的任何数量，从而不必受固定容量集群的限制。AWS Batch还可以利用 Spot 实例，从而进一步降低运行批处理作业产生的费用。\nAWS Batch服务本身是免费的，仅收取实际使用的 EC2 实例费用。\n我创建了一个Batch App demo来演示AWS Batch相关使用方法。该示例通过一个Restful API接口来提交批处理任务，Restful API通过ALB + Lambda函数来暴露服务。Lambda函数被触发后，将新任务请求发送到SQS服务。随后另一个Lambda将消费这个SQS，并将调用AWS Batch API来提交新的批处理任务，同时将任务信息储存到DynamoDB中。同时Demo创建了Batch任务会使用到的Docker Image，并且预先提交到ECR中。同时Batch任务定义了使用的EC2实例类型(c5系列实例，且包括Spot和按需两种计费方式的实例，且优先使用Spot实例)，实例默认伸缩数量为0(没有可执行任务时将中止实例)。并且提交的任务分为计算任务和统计归并任务，统计归并任务会依赖所以计算任务执行完毕才开始执行。最后通过另一Restful接口查询计算任务的最终结果，该接口同样使用ALB + Lambda函数来实现。\nEnjoy this Batch App demo orchestrated by AWS CDK.\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2019/aws-batch/","section":"posts","tags":["AWS","Batch","Infrastructure as Code"],"title":"AWS

CDK的出现解决了目前CloudFormation存在的绝大部分问题，极大的提升基础设施编排代码的开发和维护效率。\nAWS CDK是一种开源软件开发框架，开发者可以用自己使用熟悉的编程语言模拟和预置云应用程序资源，目前支持Typescript/Javascript、Python、Java和.Net。AWS CDK将云中资源抽象对象化，通过极其简单语法描述资源对象或设置其各种属性(重载CDK默认属性设置)来创建或更新云中资源。\n例如，下面简单几行将创建一个新的名为Gameday的VPC网络，并且跨了两个可用区分别创建了公有子网和私有子网。\n1 this.vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, \u0026#39;Gameday\u0026#39;, { 2 cidr:

CDK是一个非常值得采用的云中资源编排和管理方式，高效的管理了AWS上的资源。\n由于CDK还在相对早期，成熟度还不是那么完美。我在使用中发现下面一些值得注意的问题。\nCDK程序最终还是创建了CloudFormation配置，提交到CloudFormation完成资源变更。核心的用户体验，需要依赖CloudFormation的能力。CloudFormation的创建或回退超时过长，时常影响资源部署体验。另外，清理资源的时候，遇到部分资源无法清理且缺少明确提示。比如Aurora集群。 CDK类库缺少配置校验。这类错误只能通过CloudFormation部署后，才会被资源方发现并返回错误。导致整个创建的堆栈回退，调试大型的部署栈将花费比较长的时间。建议将整个部署拆分为多个小的堆栈，减小每次部署时间，方便调试。 文档还比较简陋。缺少较为深入的示例。增加了开发人员的学习曲线。 新版本向后兼容性不够好，时常新版本有break changes。在1.0GA之后发布的版本break

Function就是针对这种情况专门开发的跨serverless平台的框架，实现一套代码通过不同的打包实现跨serverless平台。Spring Clound Function目前支持AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure Function以及Apache OpenWhisk。\n这里我们继续使用无函数版本的钉钉回掉函数来演示Spring Clound Function for AWS的使用。\n首先将spring cloud function for aws adapter添加到项目依赖，\n1implementation(\u0026#34;org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-function-adapter-aws:${springCloudFunctionVersion}\u0026#34;) 其次创建函数Handler，实现Spring Cloud Function跨函数计算实现抽象的SpringBootRequestHandler类，或者是继承自它的trigger类，例如SpringBootApiGatewayRequestHandler\n1import org.springframework.cloud.function.adapter.aws.SpringBootApiGatewayRequestHandler 2 3class Handler : SpringBootApiGatewayRequestHandler() 接下来创建Spring Boot应用程序，并将serverless实现函数注册为Spring Bean，函数的实现部分就是serverless函数具体做的业务逻辑。\n1@SpringBootApplication 2open class DingtalkCallbackApplication { 3 4 @Bean 5 open fun dingtalkCallback(): Function\u0026lt;Message\u0026lt;EncryptedEvent\u0026gt;, Map\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt;\u0026gt; { 6 val callback = Callback() 7 return Function { 8 callback.handleRequest(it) 9 } 10 } 11} 12fun main(args: Array\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;) { 13 SpringApplication.run(DingtalkCallbackApplication::class.java, *args) 14} 最后将函数打包为fat jar（如果将依赖打包为lambda layer，可不用打包为fat jar）作为lambda的代码。\n函数的部署同其他的lambda函数没有任何区别，这个示例中沿用了之前的SAM/CloudFormation配置或者serverless framework部署配置。\n完整的可运行、部署代码请访问这个分支。\n总体来说，Spring Clound Function的实现原理并不复杂，定义统一的函数实现入口，通过不同serverless平台的adapter对接不同平台的API接口，做到编写一次函数实现，通过打包不同的adapter做到跨serverless平台运行。\n但个人认为现实中这样的场景并不多。并且serverless函数触发方式很多，例如AWS上的APIGateway、Kinesis、CloudWatch、IoT等服务，与这些服务对接或API调用其实也产生了耦合，并不能简单的迁移到三方的serverless平台去执行。同时，开发者需要引入spring/spring boot/spring cloud相关的依赖，增加了程序的复杂度，又延长了lambda函数clod start需要的时间。另外，开发者需要学习spring cloud function相关的知识，无形中增加了复杂度。总之使用spring cloud

select等服务及工具解决海量数据的大数据处理。\nAWS一直将PAYG(Pay-As-You-Go)的按量计费模型贯穿在各种服务中。无论是EC2(包括GPU实例)，ELB，NAT网关等等都提供小时级的按量计费。阿里云在这方面还有较多的改进空间，例如GPU实例最小售卖时长为一周，SLB首先按规格售卖，NAT网关按自然日计费。\nIAM为云上的资源提供了最细粒度的授权管理，AWS各个服务严格按最细粒度控制授权，满足企业的权限管理。在我使用过的数个阿里云服务中，多次遇到较新的服务IAM设计不周，权限粒度过大，甚至功能无法工作的情况下就上线发布了。\nAWS CloudFormation提供了云上资源编排管理，实现了资源的代码化，版本化(通常称为的Infrastrucure as Code)。将云端资源的管理运维提升到一个新的层次。\nAWS提供了三种方式管理云上资源，Web Console, CLI以及API。这三种方式，尽最大努力提供一致的功能。\nAWS同时是一个云计算的生态，各类三方云服务厂商通过Marketplace售卖各类SaaS，PaaS服务，形成一个云计算用户，三方服务Vendor，AWS三方共赢的局面。\n总得说来，AWS持续的在云计算核心服务和关键服务投入，不停的创新，保证了AWS整体服务的领先。\n接下来看看阿里云的强项。\n阿里云在提供基本的计算、存储、网络外，额外提供了很多SaaS服务，例如，Application Performance Monitor， Performance Testing Service, 日志服务，链路追踪服务，数据库管理服务等。这些服务显然同阿里云有更好的集成，对用户来说提供了开箱即用的解决方案。而这也是一把双刃剑，利用平台捆绑的优势抢占合作开发商的市场，长期来说利用平台垄断不利于基于阿里云的技术服务创业。\n总之，阿里云在云计算核心服务上同AWS比还有差距，但他在PaaS/SaaS服务上发展不错，更加容易提供全套基于阿里云的解决方案。由于阿里云在国内数据中心数量上的优势加上从万网收购的BGP资源，其服务在国内访问网络延迟会更低。\n最后，谈一个很有意思的话题，是否需要考虑云厂商的锁定。\nKubernetes事实上成为容器编排平台，首先考虑使用K8S及CNCF landscape下的项目作为应用运行环境，减少可能的迁移和学习成本。\n对不同用量的公司来说，考虑云厂商锁定的维度完全不一样。创业型公司或仍在快速发展业务中的中大型企业首先应该选择可靠性高，解决方案多，易学习的云厂商，尽可能利用云厂商的各种服务做到快速高效可靠的推进业务，将尽量多的精力、人力投入到业务相关的事情上。业务稳定的大型公司，可以使用多数据中心实现关键业务的高可用性，跨云完全不应该作为高可用的必要解决途径。另外，云厂商绝对会投入额外的人力，优先级支持他们的大客户，甚至为这类客户调整产品研发优先级或协同完成某些功能，这样绝对是个双赢的局面，Netflix和AWS的互相成就就是一个很好的例子。没有特别必要的原因，不要轻易投入精力将业务从服务已经很稳定的云厂商迁移到多云平台上，那样往往是白白耗费力气。\n下面是slide的最新完整版本，\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2019/aws-vs-aliyun/","section":"posts","tags":["云计算","AWS","阿里云"],"title":"公有云对比"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/%E9%98%BF%E9%87%8C%E4%BA%91/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"阿里云"},{"body":"Serverless

Computing(无服务器计算)是目前最被看好的云端计算执行模型。其最大的好处是提供分布式弹性可伸缩的计算执行环境，仅为实际使用资源付费，并且将应用维护者从常规的运维事务中解放出来，更利于专注到具体的业务上。\n在主流的应用部署方式下，无论是使用云主机还是Kubernetes作为运行环境，都会有大量运维层面的事务需要考虑和处理，并且应用程序需要按照分布式程序的设计准则来应对应用的水平伸缩。同时随着云计算服务的发展和完善，云计算厂商提供了越来越多的基础服务，例如API网关、对象存储、消息队列、日志、监控等服务，函数计算可以完美的同其他云服务集成，帮助用户快速实现出生产级别的弹性可伸缩的应用。\n那函数计算是什么呢？让我们一起来看看阿里云对于函数计算的定义。\n阿里云函数计算是事件驱动的全托管计算服务。通过函数计算，您无需管理服务器等基础设施，只需编写代码并上传。函数计算会为您准备好计算资源，以弹性、可靠的方式运行您的代码，并提供日志查询、性能监控、报警等功能。借助于函数计算，您可以快速构建任何类型的应用和服务，无需管理和运维。而且，您只需要为代码实际运行所消耗的资源付费，代码未运行则不产生费用。\n基于函数计算的特点，可以很好满足以下需求，\n业务流量不确定或有明细的周期性 构建分布式系统经验不足 无需运维 按需计算 计费灵活 由于函数计算的扩展能力，对运维的要求极少，按量计费等特性用于需要快速验证的早期项目也是非常好的场景。\n下面这个slide是近期针对阿里云函数计算做的分享。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/effective-cloud-computing/serverless-computing-101/","section":"posts","tags":["云计算","FaaS","阿里云","函数计算","Serverless

Basic认证保护。由于HTTP Basic认证是通过预设的用户、密码认证，认证信息比较容易泄露。即使定期更换密码，但需要额外的机制通知用户密码的变更，用户体验也不好。 系统自身支持认证，甚至支持多种认证机制。比如最常用的开源CI/CD工具，Jenkins内置支持本地数据库认证、通过插件支持多种第三方系统集成认证。如果大量的IT系统都有一套独立的用户管理，随着企业的员工的变更，用户的增删等操作对系统管理员来说是不小的工作量。同时，也很容易由于人为疏忽，造成资产、数据的安全隐患。 假设企业自身已经有了一套OA系统包含员工、组织结构管理，例如，国内目前最为普及流行的钉钉或企业微信。我们完全可以提供一套基于oauth 2.0协议的认证方式，让以上两类IT系统使用企业已有的OA系统(钉钉或企业微信)来实现登录认证。做到这一点后，企业无论有多少IT系统都不再需要额外管理用户的成本，并且也避免了数据安全隐患。\n钉钉通过钉钉开放平台提供的API开放了许多钉钉内部的能力，例如，身份验证、通讯录管理等等。然而钉钉的三方网站登录接口并不是标准的oauth 2.0协议实现，我们需要通过一个oauth2 proxy代理工具实现将钉钉的三方网站登录兼容oauth2协议。同理，使用这个oauth2代理工具，可以使用Google、Facebook等三方网站作为统一认证方式。\n有了基于钉钉的oauth2代理作为企业统一登录方式，对于上面两大类系统的认证需求解决方案分别如下，\n部署在Kubernetes中无内置认证机制的Web应用，通过nginx-ingress的外部OAUTH认证实现基于oauth2的安全认证。 Jenkins可以通过反向代理插件实现使用oauth2认证登录。 在下篇中，我们将图文详解如何一步步实现为一个无认证的企业文档Web应用添加基于钉钉的统一认证。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/effective-cloud-computing/oauth2-proxy-on-kubernetes/part1/","section":"posts","tags":["云计算","IAM","kubernetes","oauth2","钉钉","dingtalk"],"title":"为Kubernetes中任意应用添加基于oauth2的认证保护 (上)"},{"body":"企业使用公有云服务的第一件事情就是创建云帐号，有了帐号之后如何让企业员工安全合规的使用云帐号下的各种资源是开启云之旅后的第一个考验。\n云计算厂商针对企业上云后面临的第一个需求已经推出了完善的解决方案--Identity and Access Management。IAM可以帮助云帐号安全地控制对云计算服务资源的访问。企业可以使用IAM控制对哪个用户进行身份验证 (登录) 和授权 (具有权限) 以使用资源。\n云厂商是否提供完善的IAM服务可以作为整体产品解决方案是否成熟的一个衡量指标，比如AWS的IAM和阿里云的访问控制都是较为成熟完善的产品。国内某个以AI能力为卖点的云厂商，在IAM产品方面几乎为零，很难相信对安全合规有需求的企业会完整使用他的云产品作为解决方案。\nIAM通常提供以下功能:\n对云账户的共享访问权限 允许在一个云账户下创建并管理多个用户身份，并允许给单个身份或一组身份（既可以是当前云帐号下也可以是其他云帐号下）分配不同的权限策略，从而实现不同用户拥有不同的云资源访问权限，而不必共享云帐号根用户的密码或访问密钥。\n精细权限 可以针对不同资源向不同人员授予不同权限。可以要求用户必须使用安全信道（如 SSL）、在指定时间范围、或在指定源 IP 条件下才能操作指定的云资源。\n多重验证 (MFA) 可以向云账户和各个用户添加双重身份验证以实现更高安全性。借助MFA，用户不仅必须提供使用账户所需的密码或访问密钥，还必须提供来自经过特殊配置的设备的代码。\n联合身份 可以允许已在其他位置（例如，在企业网络中或通过 Internet 身份提供商）获得密码的用户获取对云账户的用户访问权限。\n后面会有专门的文章来讲如何实践联合身份。\n统一账单 云账户接收包括所有用户的资源操作所发生费用的统一账单。\n尽管IAM提供了上面种种功能，云帐号的管理者仍可通过一些最佳实践来更好的使用IAM产品来提升安全级别和减少运维成本。\nIAM最佳实践 尽量不要使用云帐号的根用户，不要为根用户创建AK。云帐号管理员也使用各自独立的子账号。 为企业中每一个需要使用云服务的员工单独创建子账户，且默认不允许创建AK。便于员工离职的时候，通过删除帐号来完全清理用户在云计算平台的各种权限。 密码安全实践， 限制密码强度不少于8位，必须由大小写字母、数字和符号中的三种组成。 强制密码过期时间不超过90天，且过期后不可登录。 新密码至少禁止使用前3次密码。 设置密码重试约束，例如，一小时内使用错误密码最大尝试9次登录。 强制所有用户启用两步认证。 对访问网络有限制的企业，可以开启登录IP限制。 [推荐做法]已有SSO单点登录系统的企业，可以通过SAML 2.0标准实现从企业本地账号系统登录到阿里云，从而满足企业的统一用户登录认证要求。 细粒度的权限管理， 为各种云资源创建最细粒度的权限策略。例如，分别为RDS实例rds-instance-1创建只读权限策略rds-instance-1-readonly-access，RDS实例rds-instance-2创建只读权限策略rds-instance-2-readonly-access。 根据职能、部门等维度为云帐号子用户创建用户组。例如，按项目创建用户组，group-project-a，group-project-b。如果project-a用户需要访问rds-instance-1的信息，将自定义权限rds-instance-1-readonly-access授权给group-project-a。再将相关用户加到用户组group-project-a中，这样这些用户就具有只读访问RDS实例rds-instance-1的权限。而不是将所有RDS的读写权限都授予这些用户，最大限度的保证用户不获取超过实际需要的权限。 在实际场景中，通常会通过云计算服务的API来完成某些周期性任务，比如每日RDS中的慢查询统计、云帐号每日花费统计等。这些任务都需要一个云帐号的AK来完成API的身份认证。最佳的做法是，为每类相关的任务创建一个功能性子账号，禁用他们的web登录，且遵循特殊的命名规范(functional-开头)，比如functional-rds-stats、functional-cost-stats。创建最小的权限策略，然后分配给这些功能性用户。例如，functional-rds-stats仅被授予RDS只读权限，functional-cost-stats仅被授予费用的只读权限。为这些子账号创建AK，每类任务使用不同的AK来完成API认证，而不是都使用同一个AK。这样的好处是，不同类型任务的AK具有不同的权限，最大限度的保护了云帐号的安全，并且这些AK不跟实际的员工子账号关联，不会因为员工帐号的变更而受影响。如有更高的安全合规的要求下，可以定期作废已有AK，创建新AK替换。至于AK怎样安全管理，之后会有专门的文章来详解。

Native已经被越来越接受的今天，基于Kubernetes部署、编排应用的方式已经是业界的事实标准。无论是互联网巨头，传统500强企业，还是创业团队都在使用或规划使用Kubernetes作为应用程序的自动化部署、可扩展管理平台。在云计算平台，虚拟机越来越不需要单独的管理，在绝大多数的业务场景下，它们只是作为容器集群所管理的计算资源。甚至虚拟机的创建到销毁整个生命周期管理都可以由Kubernetes根据集群的负载来自动完成。\n所有主流的云计算厂商都在解决方案中力推托管的Kubernetes，AWS的EKS，Azure上的AKS，当然少不了Google家GCP上的Kubernetes Engine。国内阿里云，腾讯云等每一个公有云玩家也都基于开源Kubernetes推出了托管服务。如果一家云计算厂商在提供托管Kubernetes这一服务上没跟上业界的步伐，将来极大可能被淘汰出这个市场。\n托管的Kubernetes类型 以国内的阿里云为例，目前提供了两大类三种不同的Kubernetes托管服务。\n经典Dedicated Kubernetes模式。这种模式下用户可以选择宿主机实例规格和操作系统，指定Kubernetes版本、自定义Kubernetes特性开关设置等。用户需要手动维护集群，例如升级Kubernetes版本，内置组件版本等。可以手动或自动伸缩集群节点数目。目前该模式下有两种类型，第一种集群主节点需要使用用户的ECS，用户可远程登录或管理这些ECS。另一种是，主节点也由云厂商托管，用户只能通过API Server管理Kubernetes。在费用方面，无论是否托管集群主节点，集群服务免费，按使用的ECS实例及计费方式收费。 Serverless 模式(目前公测中，暂时免费)。无需创建底层虚拟化资源，可以利用 Kubernetes 命令指明应用容器镜像、CPU和内存要求以及对外服务方式，直接启动应用程序。按容器使用的CPU和内存资源量计费。这种模式下应该是在一个集群内实现多租户，目前有些features不被支持。例如，部署不支持DaemonSet，Ingress不支持NodePort类型，存储不支持PV和PVC等。 用户可以根据自己的业务类型来选择适合的托管Kubernetes集群。如果部署的应用是无状态的Web服务，可以选择Serverless Kubernetes集群，进一步减少运维工作量。\n如果用户部署的应用有状态，需要挂载外部存储，例如MongDB集群，MQ集群，可以选择经典Dedicated Kubernetes模式。如果用户需要通过Kubernetes组件扩展或自定义实现某些功能，这些需求云厂商的标准版并没有提供，这时可以选择经典Dedicated Kubernetes模式，利用Kubernetes高度灵活的扩展机制来满足自定义需求。\n托管Kuberentes的优势 国内的阿里云有篇技术文档对比阿里云Kubernetes vs. 自建Kubernetes，文章看起来虽然有厂商自卖自夸的嫌疑。作为阿里云K8S的客户，在使用托管K8S近一年来，深切的体会到云厂商托管K8S带来的种种好处，文档中提到的种种优势确实是言之凿凿。\n接下来具体看看云厂商托管K8S到底有哪些优势。\n便捷 通过Web界面/API一键创建Kubernetes集群，集群升级。 Web界面/API实现集群的扩容或缩容。 集群的安装，补丁以及常规版本升级在运维工作中属于体力活。在规模不大的时候，使用人工实现需要花费不少时间准备环境测试验证，且易错。如果集群体量不够大的话，开发自动化运维脚本又浪费人力成本。云计算厂商的托管K8S集群将提供专业、稳定的技术运维服务，和几乎为零的人力成本。\n从效率和人力成本上看，托管K8S集群完胜自建Kubernetes集群。\n功能更强大 Kubernetes作为一个容器编排系统，开源版本中许多组件没有默认实现或实现有限，需要跟运行环境(如托管K8S的云平台)集成。例如，存储，Load Balancer，网络等核心组件。官方文档Internal load balancer就提供了在不同的云厂商环境中的使用示例。部署一个强大且完整的K8S集群需要同许多云计算的基础组件集成(且只能通过API完成)，这往往是云计算厂商的强项。\n云厂商托管的K8S可以在以下方面提供强大的云计算平台支持，\n网络 高性能 VPC 网络插件。 支持 network policy 和流控。 负载均衡 支持创建公网或内网负载均衡实例，或者复用已有实例。支持指定带宽大小、计费方式、4层或7层协议代理等云厂商负载均衡功能。对应用运维来说可以把负载均衡的配置通过代码实现，并且支持版本控制。对比传统的云端部署，也可以将应用部署和应用运维集成在一起统一管理，避免应用发布和运维配置的割裂，减少人为运维失误。\n阿里云托管K8S的负载均衡详细配置可以参考这个文档，AWS上见此文档。\n存储 集成了云厂商的云盘、文件存储NAS、块存储等存储方案，基于标准的FlexVolume驱动，提供了最佳的无缝集成。\n如果是在云厂商的虚拟机上自建Kubernetes集群，默认无法使用云上的存储资源。如果需要利用云厂商提供的存储方案，例如对象存储，就需要自行开发基于FlexVolume的驱动。在厂商托管K8S已经完美解决了存储集成的问题，何必自己又去费时费力的定制开发呢？\n可以看到，云厂商托管的K8S集群在网络、负载均衡和存储上有许多天然的优势。在其他几个维度，托管的K8S集群同样也优于自建的K8S，\n运维 集成厂商的日志服务，监控服务。 K8S集群cluster autoscaler自动利用云厂商的弹性伸缩扩缩容集群节点。 镜像仓库 高可用，支持大并发。 支持镜像加速。 支持 p2p 分发。 可集成云平台的用户权限。 部分厂商目前免费且不限容量。 高可用 提供多可用区支持。 支持备份和容灾。 技术支持 专门的技术团队保障容器的稳定性。 每个 Linux 版本，每个 Kubernetes 版本都会在经过严格测试之后之后才会提供给用户。 提供 Kubernetes 升级能力，新版本一键升级。 为开源软件提供兜底，无论是K8S、Docker甚至Linux自身的问题提供支持。 专业的技术团队是提供稳定K8S服务必不可少的。但绝大多数企业是无法做到有专业的技术团队来维护K8S、提供K8S或容器技术自身的各种最佳实践、发现以及修复开源软件Bug。\n在笔者的使用托管K8S的时候就遇到这样的状况。其中一个集群升级到新版本Kubernetes后，内置DNS组件从KubeDNS被替换为全新的CoreDNS，而当时的CoreDNS版本在Service ExternalName支持上有Bug，导致已有的这种Service无法提供服务。在同云厂商的技术团队沟通后，先用workaround将问题快速绕过，不影响业务的使用。同时，云厂商的技术人员（也是K8S社区committer）继续调研，发现该问题是CoreDNS的Bug。在为开源CoreDNS项目创建Issue后，同时提供Patch，又在CoreDNS committer建议下完善了测试用例，推动了该问题快速在CoreDNS中被修复。CoreDNS包含Fix的版本发布后，云厂商技术支持团队将更完美的解决方案提供给了我们。作为K8S服务的用户，这种体验是极好的。当时我们的技术团队既没有精力也没有能力快速发现并修复开源软件中的这类问题，而云厂商的服务间接帮我们实现了这种能力。\n这其实是一种非常好的共赢商业模式，云厂商有能力且有动力投入顶尖技术团队将开源技术商业化，云厂商的用户则用最小的代价获得了最优的基础服务来为核心业务赋能。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/effective-cloud-computing/using-kubernetes-on-cloud/","section":"posts","tags":["云计算","阿里云","AWS","kubernetes"],"title":"不要自建Kubernetes"},{"body":"这是“如何高效使用云服务”系列文章的引子。该系列将讲述如何利用各种公有云服务来安全合规、高质量、快速、低成本的打造产品/系统，帮助企业（特别是中小微创业团队）在人少，钱缺的情况下做到最高效率。\n个人使用公有云服务的经历 初会 最早是2012年在parttime项目中开始接触使用云计算服务，当时的初创团队也是希望用最低的成本来验证idea，所有使用了云服务来做POC。目前国内市场最领先的云计算厂商阿里云那时也才提供公有云服务不到1年。由于云产品不够成熟，加上团队技能经验不足，自助互助的渠道不畅，导致最初的云计算使用体验并不好，团队没有选择完全使用云服务构建产品。\nIaaS or PaaS 云计算兴起的早期，云厂商大致分为两类，提供基于IaaS或PaaS的云服务。2013年起也有尝试不同类型的厂商平台，虽然也较好的完成一些体量不大的项目，但要在他们上面构建大规模用户产品或企业级应用，在云产品完善度上或支持开发团队协作上都有不少欠缺，还有大量的基础工作或限制留给了开发团队自身解决。\nAll-in Cloud 2015年我开始一个微电影项目创业，团队是不到10人的微型团队。从效率和成本考虑，我们将所有的服务都放到了阿里云上。我们使用了多种云产品，例如，云主机（多种OS），对象存储，图片处理，CDN，SLB，人脸识别等云服务，结合Devops集成开发，测试，部署pipeline来加速产品的迭代和更新。每名工程师承担一种以上角色，前端，后端，运维，数据，视频渲染等。合理使用云厂商的各种产品帮我们在质量，效率，成本上获得巨大的收益。\n2017年我加入了一家企业财税服务的初创公司负责技术团队。公司在2018年获得了B轮投资，研发产品运营团队近百人，属于中等规模。随着各种开源技术的巨大进步和影响逐步扩大，微服务架构的流行，基于Kubernetes的Cloud Native Computing兴起。我们利用云厂商的容器服务，DBaaS，Big Data，AI技术等用最高效的方式将数个单体应用平滑升级到高可用弹性的分布式架构，更好的满足复杂业务的多变需求，公司服务也在全国300多个城市落地，服务了数十万中小微企业客户。同时利用云厂商的VPC，访问控制，WAF等产品进行权限控制和安全保护，有效防范了因为团队扩大管理难度增加而出现安全问题。\n缘起 作为一名云计算服务6年的用户，见证了开源技术的快速发展和影响力急剧扩大，感受到整个云计算行业和厂商的长足进步。见证了国内头部云厂商从最初的使用难度颇大，现在成长为万众创业的首选服务商。\n过去的一年参加了数场技术会议，其中主题大多偏向于由知名的互联网或行业公司分享在海量数据下的技术应用。这些技术广泛涉及开发语言、应用架构、性能、大数据、机器学习和人工智能等领域，无论这些公司是否采用开源产品，在团队单兵技术能力，专业的分工，对开源项目的研发投入力量，这些经验和方法并不是中小企业可以轻易借鉴的。而云计算厂商将这些领域最基础通用的能力以产品的方式输出给用户，以按用量的方式计费，使用更简单，有专业团队维护和支持。中小团队就应该将这些事情“外包”给云厂商，集中精力到业务上，将最大的研发资源用到最核心最关键的地方。\n我同团队同事沟通中，和公司研发候选人面试交流中，发现许多从业者对云计算服务了解还不够深入。许多人理解中的云计算服务只有云服务器、云数据库等少数产品，需要自己安装维护应用服务器、负载均衡、收集日志等等看起来每个应用都绕不开的事情。他们的认知还停留在排查应用异常还需要远程登录服务器看日志，做不到合理的根据场景高效组合使用云服务，将云服务当做水电一样，作为最基础的能力加速业务的发展。业务上是采用名气大且成熟的产品，尝试新鲜看起来酷但不那么完善的产品，还是二次开发或自研开发？要做出最优的选择需要工程师能够从有高度的全局角度来考量，甚至在短时间内能用POC项目验证多个可选的方案，基于数据做出最终的选择。\n这就是这个系列的缘起，之后我将陆续分享使用那些高效的云服务产品的场景、心得、体会等等。\n封面图片Cloud

今年参加了几次技术会议，微服务、容器技术、区块链、大数据、机器学习以及人工智能都是当下最热门的主题。同样这次ArchSummit绝大部分topics都跟这些主题相关。\n这次会议主要参加了两个专场主题，Kubernetes的应用和快手科技技术专题。\n基于 Kubernetes 的 DevOps是来自微软Azure的容器工程师分享如何基于 Kubernetes 的 CI/CD 落地实践。该分享中提到了CI/CD各个步骤中都有众多的工具支持，如何选择合适Kubernetes的工具将持续集成和部署串联在一起是Devops中的主要挑战。分享者也安利了AKS提供Devops完整的工具链，以及将开源工具同AKS中的服务集成实现CI/CD的最佳实践。\n我们噼里啪团队在CI/CD、Devops这块做得还不错。CI/CD pipelines持续将应用部署在运行的Kubernetes集群，过程中使用的工具链基本也是社区或CNCF推荐的主流工具。下一步可以考虑同云厂商的Devops工具链集成，进一步减少维护成本。\n基于Istio on Kubernetes云原生应用的最佳实践来自阿里云容器工程师的分享。他概要的分享了Istio技术和实现原理。当然也大力介绍了阿里云容器服务对Istio的原生支持，以及阿里云对客户使用Istio的支持，即使客户问题非常的初级他们的技术支持也很到位。\nIstio可以说是CNCF在Kubernetes上事实的服务治理实现。噼里啪技术团队也一直在关注这一块，正在尝试引入Istio提升服务的SLA。\n快手技术团队的4个分享都是围绕解决明确的业务问题而做得技术工作，非常具有实战性。其中快手万亿级实时 OLAP 平台的建设与实践介绍了快手实时OLAP平台从0到1的搭建过程。该平台从今年4月开始搭建，截止到11月，每日可以实时计算处理超过万亿的数据。而整个平台的搭建由两名大数据工程师外加一名前端工程师负责portal等UI，人效产出让人非常佩服。结合朋友间传言快手给技术人员的offer，快手应该是一家在实践类似Netflix管理文化的公司。\n最后给大家推荐一个国产的分布式New SQL数据库TiDB相关的主题。TiDB是国内技术团队开源的一个分布式数据库，已被CNCF作为Database实现推荐方案之一。他们的CTO分享了TiDB on Kubernetes 最佳实践，以及他们客户北京银行在两地多活的核心系统中采用的数据库就是TiDB。\n个人感受 会议的分享者大多来自国内一线的互联网公司，他们普遍具备流量大、数据多、技术团队能力更强等特质。并且很少使用公有云服务，使用开源产品多数也会维护私有版本。他们的业务解决方案对中小型技术团队来说可复制性不强，照搬实施的难度高，更多的是在扩展思路了解业界技术动态。中小型技术团队最紧迫的事情是满足业务快速发展和需求多变，更合理的解法是选用云厂商的服务或第三方服务快速高效的满足业务需求。极客邦旗下的会议大多缺少这类的分享，相比之下AWS的reInvent大会在这方面做得更好。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2018/2018-12-13-bj-archsummit-review/","section":"posts","tags":["会议","架构","ArchSummit"],"title":"2018北京ArchSummit回顾"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/archsummit/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ArchSummit"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/jenkins/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Jenkins"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/trouble-shooting/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Trouble-Shooting"},{"body":"V秘开发团队一直使用着Jenkins

1docker service create --name vme-nginx --network vme-network --replicas 1 \\ 2 --publish 80:80 --publish 443:443 \\ 3 nginx:1.11 无法为Docker Swarm内运行的服务设置主机名。通过docker run命令执行的容器可以设置hostname。比如， 1docker

web服务器会将默认的页面响应给浏览器，比如index.html或index.php等。\n浏览器返回的页面里面引入了Angularjs和其他应用需要的JS库。Angularjs应用开始执行后，尝试处理路由**/app/page1**。如果应用定义了该路由，将加载必要的JS库和其他html片段来完成页面的渲染。\n理解了Angularjs页面内路由的原理后，我们知道了对浏览器或搜索引擎爬虫而言，单页面应用所有的页面对浏览器和搜索引擎都是一个网址，比如http://mydomain.com/。这样对爬虫抓取站内链接造成了困难，因为所有应用内的链接都被认做了同一个链接。\n我们理解了uri http://mydomain.com/#/app/page1给SEO造成的麻烦，接下来就是讨论如何针对SEO来作的优化。\n最理想的情况当然是搜索引擎爬虫变的更加智能，它能理解网站的框架，并且针对此种情况做出优化。但截止到目前，包括Google在内的所有爬虫都无法做到这点。那我们SEO的优化只能在应用这边来做了。\nAngularjs提供了一种HTML5 mode模式可以利用HTML5 History API来实现页面内路由。打开的方法如下，\n1$locationProvider.html5Mode(true); 同时在index.html页面加上如下标签，\n1\u0026lt;base href=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 在打开HTML5 mode后的Angularjs应用的链接看起来就是这样了，\nhttp://mydomain.com/app/page1\n新的链接模式和站内跳转通过访问网站主页请求将没有任何问题。然而直接在浏览器请求如上链接的话，Web服务器将尝试请求/app/page1，通常会得到404的页面响应。因为服务器上并没有部署页面/app/page1。\n这时就需要在Web应用服务器或应用里面实现URL Rewrite。将/app/page1的请求转到单页面应用html文件上。\n下面是一些Web服务器或应用的参考配置，\nApache Rewrites\n1\u0026lt;VirtualHost *:80\u0026gt; 2 ServerName my-app 3 4 DocumentRoot /path/to/app 5 6 \u0026lt;Directory

还好目前有workaround，挂载的时候指定参数，-ouid=your_uid -ogid=your_gid来指定文件的owner。 性能极其低下！！！一台ECS主机挂载了一个使用内网地址的oss bucket，bucket根下面有2k+子目录（对文件系统而言）,bucket内文件总计有28G。然而执行ls /tmp/\u0026lt;bucket mount point\u0026gt;超过10分钟都无法完成。而我们V秘之前用Java实现的AliyunOSSFS执行同样的操作只需要数秒。 阿里云相关的技术支持人员及其不专业。很多文件系统，FUSE等概念都不甚了解。跟他们沟通这些技术问题，首先要花时间进行教育。花费大量时间来沟通，进展确缓慢。 总之，阿里云ossfs这个工具远远没有达到production ready的质量。无法使用到生产环境中。 ","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2016/aliyun-ossfs-sucks/","section":"posts","tags":["aliyun","oss","ossfs","阿里云"],"title":"说一说阿里云ossfs"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/wechat/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Wechat"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/weixin/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Weixin"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/%E5%85%AC%E4%BC%97%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"公众平台"},{"body":"微信给公众平台提供了素材管理的接口，通过这一系列接口可以上传，接收以及管理图片，视频等多媒体文件。其中又分为临时和永久两种类型。永久素材有总量的限制，临时素材微信服务器只给保存3天。\n最近V秘刚好有个同微信用户互动的场景，为用户美化微信拍摄的小视频。V秘后台服务器收到用户发送过来小视频（微信将其认做临时素材），将其美化处理后，再将美化的视频上传为临时素材，最终美化后的视频作为视频类型的客服消息被推送给用户。整个流程很简洁，用户发送小视频后，就坐等观看美化后的小视频了。\n然而最终经过V秘开发团队的实践及测试，得出的结论是，\n##微信公众平台的临时素材不能用！绝对的鸡肋！\n公众平台上传素材的API以及使用已有素材发送视频消息API都很健壮。但问题出在了微信后台资源的服务上面。\n开发者把图片视频成功上传为临时素材后，会从微信的接口得到这个素材的ID。这个ID随后作为给用户发送图文消息或视频消息的资源。微信后台会把这个ID对应到素材的真实URL路径上。这个过程是没有问题的。同时微信作为一个拥有海量用户的软件，它会将这些将要推送给用户的素材都发布到它的CDN。用户收到的最终图片视频的地址就是素材文件在微信/腾讯CDN上的地址。对CDN有了解的朋友都知道，CDN服务器分散在全国或全世界各地，当用户请求这个资源的时候，请求会被路由到离用户最近的CDN服务器上。当CDN服务器上还没有缓存请求的资源时，这时候有个溯源的过程。就是原始文件从文件服务器传送到该CDN服务器的一个过程。这时，用户有一个额外的等待，等待时间取决于文件大小和CDN服务器和文件服务器间的带宽。\n微信用来给公众号放置临时素材的CDN在这一块出了问题。在我们的测试中，微信CDN可能一直无法提供这些临时素材（某些文件超过1天后仍然无法访问）。而且出现错误的几率相当高，至少20%以上。由于CDN无法为临时素材提供可靠的访问保障，所以我们得出微信给公众号临时素材这个功能基本就是不能用。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2016/weixin-temporary-materials/","section":"posts","tags":["weixin","wechat","微信","公众平台"],"title":"如何使用微信公众平台的临时素材"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"微信"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/pay/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Pay"},{"body":"随着AngularJS等前端MVC框架的流行，AJAX的异步请求数据结合H5的push state等特性，极大的改善了网站的用户体验和页面加载性能。这类网站应用通常只有一个入口页面，通过应用内路由到不同的页面，所以俗称单页面(signle page application)应用。页面URL看起来如下，\n网站首页 http://mysite.com/#/index 商品列表页 http://mysite.com/#/goods/list 商品详情页 http://mysite.com/#/goods/skuid 网站关于页 http://mysite.com/#/about 对浏览器而言，上面几个地址都是访问的网站**/目录，每个url不同的是hash部分。而AngularJS**正是依赖页面的hash来做的应用内路由，根据不同的路由来加载不同的js和html片段，实现动态内容的加载。\n世上并没有绝对完美的事情，单页面应用在用户体验和性能上获得了好处。然而，在别的地方必然付出代价。这里就分享一下单页面应用和微信支付集成的一些经验。\n这里的微信支付指的是，在微信浏览器中通过JS接口调起微信支付来完成网页应用中商品的购买。微信支付本身的开发集成并不复杂，这里就不赘述了。微信支付出于安全考虑，要求公众号必须注册支付发起页面的地址（到支付页面的上级目录为止），并且能够添加到白名单的地址不超过3个。也就是如果应用在商品详情页发起支付请求，那么地址**http://mysite.com/#/goods/**必须在白名单列表。\n目前为止，一切都很好理解，把支付页面加到微信支付白名单不就万事大吉了。可经过实测，事实确不是这么简单！\n在微信iOS版本中，微信支付JS会错误的使用landing网站页面的URL，而不是发起支付的页面URL！比如用户通过网站首页**http://mysite.com/#/index进入应用，通过站内链接浏览到了某商品详情页http://mysite.com/#/goods/skuid并发起了支付。但微信JS会把landing页面URLhttp://mysite.com/#/index**判定为支付的发起页面，从而导致支付JS调用失败！\n因为应用存在多个页面，不可能把所有的页面都加到支付白名单中(有3个数目限制，并且工作量也大到不现实)。要解决这个问题，只好另辟蹊径。我目前找到的方法是，强制刷新页面当打开商品详情页的时候。等同于直接在微信浏览器中打开了商品详情页。虽然对用户体验有些影响，但支付功能正常工作了。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2016/single-page-app-meets-weixin-pay/","section":"posts","tags":["weixin","wechat","pay","支付"],"title":"单页面应用(single page application)中使用微信支付"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/%E6%94%AF%E4%BB%98/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"支付"},{"body":"最近在提交前端代码后，前端代码的自动发布老是失败。失败的原因多是编译Docker镜像时在执行COPY语句拷贝文件到镜像文件系统时，扔出了'No space left on device'这个错误。这个错误根据描述非常好理解，就是docker文件系统所在磁盘没有了空间。\n但是通过df -h命令，该磁盘至少还有3，4个G的剩余空间。而前端镜像的文件大小最多也不超过300M。在该磁盘通过touch,cp仍然可以创建文件。\n所以这个问题非常奇怪，为什么docker或者操作系统抱怨磁盘没有了空间？在磁盘仍然剩余数个G的情况下？\n再通过相关的查找后，docker的这个issue给了我启发。Linux文件系统的inode在耗尽后，该文件系统将不能再创建新文件。因为前端页面是基于nodejs的程序，它依赖的packages产生了大量文件，在反复制作不同的docker images时，这些依赖文件又被反复复制，导致文件数量远远超过了默认inode和磁盘大小的比例，最终inode先于磁盘空间被全部使用。\n遇到类似问题的同学，可以通过df -i查看inode的使用情况来排查问题是否由于inode耗尽导致这个错误。\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/2016/docker-build-no-space-left-caused-by-inode-exhausted/","section":"posts","tags":["docker","troubleshoot"],"title":"文件系统的Inode耗尽，会导致Docker编译镜像出现'No space left on device'错误"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/daemon/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Daemon"},{"body":"Recently I wrote a Linux like initd script to start/stop my web application.\nThe script works well when running it in shell of linux.

This way still is not a perfect solution, but it's much better than previous trial.\nUse clearexport_ccase to export the source folder to intermittent data. See documentation of Clearcase admin. Create a temporary vob for importing the data later. See example. Import the data into temporary vob. See example. Repeat step 1 to 3 for importing all necessary data into temporary vob. Use the SVN Importer to import the temporary vob as Subversion repository. Last steps refer to a documentation of succeeded migration case of one of Eclipse project from Subversion to Git. Git definitely is greatest SCM tool now. The size of Subversion repository is around 10GB, finally the Git repository is less than 700MB, which saves more than 10 times disk space. It's awesome!\nThe flaw of this way is that the removed elements in Clearcase(said using Main/LATEST as cspec of Clearcase vob when exporting) would lose after importing into a temporary vob. So switching to a maintenance branch or tag like 1.0/2.0 in Git, the source code is incomplete. The files existed in that branch or tag, then removed in latest code base are lost. The workaround could be manually checking in GA version to have complete code.\nIf anybody have graceful and perfect solution to migrate Clearcase to Git, I think he could start a new business. :)\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/archive/blogspot/migration-clearcase-to-git-part-2/","section":"posts","tags":["Git","Clearcase"],"title":"Migration Clearcase to Git -- part 2"},{"body":"I tried to migrate the source code of project from Clearcase to Git repository. As far as I know there is no elegant solution for such migration. For purpose of this migration, I want to keep the history and label of files in Clearcase after migrating to Git repository.\nThere are mature tools to migrate CVS/SVN repository to Git, so I tried to use Subversion as a bridge for my migration.\nI used a free software 'SVN Importer' to import the Clearcase vobs to Subversion. The tool is great, and it keeps the history of files, labels and branches. The entire size of new Subversion repository has near 50GB which is unacceptable size of Git repository. The subversion repository contains a lot of legacy code and unwanted binaries, so removing those revisions could significantly reduce the size of subversion repository. And subversion provides some admin tools to manipulate the metadata of subversion, it's possible to remove the unnecessary revisions and re-create a subversion repository with refined content. But I don't have any experience to use the admin tool of subversion before, I failed to filter the unwanted data. It's not worthy of costing too much effects on it. Finally I failed to filter the subversion repository.\nActually the detail history of files is rarely used. If need, we still can find it in Clearcase. At last I manually checked in the released version of our project into Git repository, and tagged them.\nWrote this unsuccessful idea here for elapsed efforts.\n","link":"https://kane.mx/posts/archive/blogspot/migrate-clearcase-to-git/","section":"posts","tags":["Git","Clearcase"],"title":"Migrate Clearcase to Git"},{"body":"","link":"https://kane.mx/tags/p2/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"P2"},{"body":"Our p2 based on installer suffered performance issue when querying IUs from repositories.

You could see many kids with parents riding bicycle in the sunny weekend.\nThe train station and a major bus transient station are the same one that is called as 'main station' by local residents. it's not far from the office of company, about 20 minutes by foot.\nThe ticket system of bus is more complicated than Beijing's. People can buy the ticket for single, 24 hours, 48 hours, a week and even a year. The children can get discount. There's no ticket seller in the bus. Usually nobody checks whether you have valid ticket. Pressing the button to open the door when getting on/off the bus.\nThe public transportation is designed well. There are different tickets for different people. For example, tourists would prefer to buy 24 hours ticket or 48 hours tickets. 24 hours ticket means the passengers can take any bus in the 24 hours after it's used first time. So it's very convenient for tourists. 24 hours ticket is 4.2€ for adults, 2.1€ for children. The price of train tickets is same. The faster train \u0026quot;ICE\u0026quot; have higher price. The regular train is much cheaper. And the ticket allows a family not exceed 5 persons to go back and forth another city in a day.

The system bundle would be created and marked as installed when initializing the framework. Equinox also tries to install the installed bundles if finding them in persistence data during the initializing period. Of course there is no extra bundles would be installed when launching Equinox first time.\nThen Equinox launcher would install the bundles specified by vm's system property 'osgi.bundles'. And start the initial bundles that are marked as early start. For example, let's have a look at the configuration/config.ini of Eclipse, you would find a line similar as below,\nosgi.bundles=reference\\:file\\:org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator_1.0.200.v20090831.jar@1\\:start\nIt means the start level of bundle 'org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator_1.0.200.v20090831.jar' is 1, and it would be started after installing it.\nHere you would ask there are only two bundles are installed(one is system bundle 'org.eclipse.osgi', the other is 'org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator') when launching Equinox, how the other bundles are installed? It's done by the activate method of 'simpleconfigurator' bundle. The available bundles are recorded in plain text file configuration/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator/bundles.info, simpleconfigurator read the file then install those bundles.\nIt's a new bundle management introduced by p2.

step See this link for detail\nLearn P2 step by step\np2 concept p2 install p2 install practice p2 repository publish customized p2 touchpoint p2 repository publish practice Example Code Reference p2 concept 首先来理解p2引入的几个概念[1]\np2 / Agent\nThe provisioning infrastructure on client machines\nInstallable Unit (IU)\nMetadata that describes things that can be installed/configured\nArtifact\nThe actual content being installed/configured(e.g., bundle JARs)\nRepository\nA store of metadata or artifacts\nProfile\nThe target of install/management operations\nPlanner\nThe decision-making entity in the provisioning system\nEngine\nThe mechanism for executing provisioning requests\nTouchpoint\nThe part of the engine responsible for integrating the provisioning\nsystem to a particular runtime or management system\nIU比较好理解，就是对可安装或配置的部分一种描述，并不对应实际要安装的文件。\nArifact就是来描述实际要安装的文件，bundle类型的jar，feature，binary文件。\n这时就有了Repository（仓库）这个概念，是用来保存artifacts信息，以及artifacts的元数据。元数据包括了对artifact的唯一标识符，版本，对外暴露的接口信息，以及它依赖的接口及其版本信息，各个安装阶段需要执行的配置。在p2默认的实现里面，这两个repository用xml文件来描述，同时被压缩为artifacts.jar, content.jar来减小文件大小，缩短传输时间。\n从Eclipse 3.4起，当从远程site安装新的软件时，就会看到有个work thread在后台下载content.jar文件。p2在安装时候，首先会根据content.xml（metadata repository）来解析正在安装软件的依赖。在当前runtime里面查找metadata中指定的依赖，如果满足才继续安装。据我个人经验，如果安装的软件比较复杂，那它产生的metadata文件就会比较大（很容易上兆），下载这个文件以及解析它的内容都会比较慢，从而影响用户体验。\n比较灵活的是，用户可以实现自己的ArtifactRepository和MetadataRepository，注册到它们各自的Manager里面就可以了。所有这些服务都被实现为OSGi Service.\n下一个Profile，是用来管理安装目标里的软件信息。p2在被设计的时候，希望解决多个eclipse实例共享一份安装的某软件。比如为了某种目的我机器上有好几个Eclipse，同时它们都需要CDT，免去为重复安装的麻烦。profile就会记录每次安装的内容，让整个应用程序被管理起来。在Galileo里安装的软件都可以软件管理里面查找到。\nPlanner和Engine完全就是p2内部的东西。任何p2的操作（安装，删除，配置）都需要Planner实例来描述。有了Planner以后，还需要创建一个Engine对象，通过engine来执行对应的plan。这就是目前调用p2 API来完成安装的一个过程。\n最后一个Touchpoint。程序在安装的时候，可能会根据runtime(os, ws, arch等）或阶段(安装，卸载，配置等)执行某些配置，touchpoint就是帮助实现这些配置。具体操作是以IU为单位记录在metadata repository里的。p2默认实现了一些Eclipse touchpoint，比如拷贝，删除文件，执行外部程序等。如果用户有自己特殊的native操作需要执行，可以自己实现自定义的touchpoint。\np2 install 有了这些概念以后，我们来看看如何使用p2 API。以安装为例，\n首先需要得到当前安装的profile。如果是全新安装，通过IProfileRegistry.addProfile创建一个新profile。是更新安装的话，可以通过IProfileRegistry查询到期望更新的profile。创建profile的时候，需要注意设置profile的属性，\nMap\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; profileProperties = new HashMap\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt;();\nprofileProperties.put(IProfile.PROP_INSTALL_FOLDER, installLocation.getAbsolutePath());\nprofileProperties.put(IProfile.PROP_FLAVOR, \u0026quot;tooling\u0026quot;); //$NON-NLS-1$\nprofileProperties.put(IProfile.PROP_ENVIRONMENTS, \u0026quot;osgi.os=\u0026quot; + Platform.getOS() + \u0026quot;,osgi.ws=\u0026quot; + Platform.getWS() + \u0026quot;,osgi.arch=\u0026quot; + Platform.getOSArch()); //$NON-NLS-1$;\nprofileProperties.put(IProfile.PROP_NL, \u0026quot;en_US\u0026quot;); //$NON-NLS-1$\nprofileProperties.put(IProfile.PROP_INSTALL_FEATURES, \u0026quot;true\u0026quot;);\nprofileProperties.put(IProfile.PROP_CONFIGURATION_FOLDER, new File(installLocation, \u0026quot;configuration\u0026quot;).getAbsolutePath());\nprofileProperties.put(IProfile.PROP_ROAMING, \u0026quot;true\u0026quot;);\nprofileProperties.put(IProfile.PROP_CACHE, installLocation.getAbsolutePath());\ncurrentProfile = registry.addProfile(PROFILE_ID, profileProperties);\nPROP_INSTALL_FOLDER设置安装的目录，PROP_CACHE设置保存下载来的Eclipse IU(features/plugins)的目录，如果repository是以feature为单位来发布的话，需要设置PROP_INSTALL_FEATURES为true。如果repository包括native的binary（比如launcher）也需要指定正确的PROP_ENVIROMENTS，包括OS,WS,ARCH或PROCESSOR。\n然后需要获得将要安装的IMetadataRepository集合。比如：\nArrayList ius = new ArrayList();\nIMetadataRepositoryManager repositoryManager = (IMetadataRepositoryManager) ServiceHelper.getService(Activator.getDefault().getBundle().getBundleContext(),\nIMetadataRepositoryManager.class.getName()); if (repositoryManager == null) throw new InterruptedException(\u0026quot;Failed to get IMetadataRepositoryManager.\u0026quot;);\ntry {\nfor (URI uri : uris) {\nIMetadataRepository metaRepo = repositoryManager.loadRepository(uri, progress.newChild(50/uris.length));\nCollector collector = metaRepo.query(new AccpetQuery(), new LatestNoninstalledIUCollector(currentProfile), progress.newChild(50/uris.length));\nius.addAll(collector.toCollection());\n}\n} catch (ProvisionException e) {\nthrow new InterruptedException(\u0026quot;Failed to get IMetadataRepository.\u0026quot;);\n}\n-同时这里也查找出IMetaRepository中没安装过的IUs。这就需要同当前安装的profile中已经安装过的内容来比较，\nCollector collector = metaRepo.query(new AccpetQuery(), new LatestNoninstalledIUCollector(currentProfile), progress.newChild(50/uris.length));\n这里需要指出的是，IMetadataRepository实现了IQueryable接口。IQueryable是p2引入的查找接口，返回满足特殊查询条件的集合，同时传入了一个IProgressMonitor对象，可以反应查找进度。这里的AcceptQuery，LatestNoninstalledIUCollector是自定义的Query和Collector对象。p2已经实现了许多有用的Query，经常用到的有InstallableUnitQuery，IUPropertyQuery，RangeQuery。\n-接下来生成IEngine所需的ProvisionPlan。首先创建ProfileChangeRequest对象，将先前查找出的要安装的IUs添加进去。\nrequest.addInstallableUnits(ius);\n删除的话则与之相反。更新的话也需要通过ProfileChangeRequest.removeInstallableUnits()去掉旧版本的IUs。\n调用IPlanner service的getProvisioningPlan(ProfileChangeRequest, ProvisioningContext, IProgressMonitor)得到对应于当前request的plan。\n-最后就是调用IEngine.perform(IProfile, PhaseSet, Operand[], ProvisioningContext, IProgressMonitor)来执行provisioning操作。这里的PhaseSet是用来指定Engine将要执行的几个阶段，以及每个阶段的执行时间权重。这些阶段包括了Collect, Unconfigure, Uninstall, Property, CheckTrust, Install, Configure. 如果熟悉Eclipse之前的Installer Handler，对Unconfigure/Uninstall/Install/Configure应该都很熟悉。 在p2里，更是将Collect, CheckTrust这些过程也暴露了出来。下面是p2里默认PhaseSet的实现，\npublic DefaultPhaseSet() {\nthis(new Phase[] {new Collect(100), new Unconfigure(10, forcedUninstall), new Uninstall(50, forcedUninstall), new Property(1), new CheckTrust(10), new Install(50), new Configure(10)});\n}\nOperand[]通过ProvisionPlan.getOperands()获得。\np2 install practice 先制作一个可安装的repository，这里的方法是基于Eclipse提供的模版创建一个RCP程序，比如mail template,\n然后创建一个feature包含刚才创建出来的plug-in 'com.example.mail'。\n基于存在的‘com.example.mail.product’创建product configuration，将其设置为base on features, 同时在dependencies页面添加以下feature。feature的qaulifier id依赖于用到的Eclipsse版本，从下图看到我这里使用的是Eclipse 3.5.1。如果要让RCP程序具有安装插件的能力（包含p2和p2 UI），就需要依赖更多的feature。后面的example里面会实现这部分功能。另外注意：ID不能包括空格字符。\n接下来使用Eclipse Product Export Wizard生成repository。记得要勾选上generate metadata repository。\n在成功创建了Mail Application的repository后，试用我们自己的p2 installer来安装这个应用程序。安装过程类似下面的截图。然后执行/folk/kzhu0/tmp/mailrcp/mail来运行Mail Application.\np2 repository publish 这一节将会展示如何发布/产生基于p2的repository。在p2最早的版本Eclipse 3.4中将生成repository这个程序称为generator，而3.5对此重构后命名为publisher。重构后的publish过程简单明了。首先需要创建一个IPublishInfo对象，它负责提供将要生成的repository的情况。包括了meta repository, artifact repository的信息，属性，以及提供辅助信息的advice对象。IPublisherAdvice可以看作类似创建RCP窗口时候的WorkbenchAdvice和WorkbenchWindowAdvice等辅助类。它用来提供需要记录在repository中的IU特殊信息。比如IU的属性，touchpoint的类型及各个阶段执行的action，对可执行文件或配置文件IU的处理。\n此外还需要创建IPublisherAction来处理不同类型的IU发布过程。例如BundlesAction来实现发布bundles到repository，FeaturesAction则是处理feature。此外p2已提供的IPublisherAction还包括product action, config action, launcher action和jre action等等[2]。\n有了描述repository情况的publishinfo和发布各种IUs的action后，调用Publisher.publish方法完成repository的发布。\nIPublisherInfo info = createPublisherInfo();\nIPublisherAction[] actions = createActions();\nPublisher publisher = new Publisher(info);\npublisher.publish(actions, new NullProgressMonitor());\n这里有一点需要注意，publish只是把将要用于部署的features/plugins/binary发布到repository，并不负责编译打包它们。先前我们使用过Eclipse Export功能既编译打包features/plugins同时又生成repository。Export实现的过程首先是调用PDE来编译打包features/plugins，再调用对应的publisher应用程序将编译后的features/plugins/product发布为repository。\ncustomized p2 touchpoint 前面一节已经提过IPublishInfo通过额外的IPublisherAdvise来定制发布到repository的IU信息。这里介绍为自己的IU定制新的touchpoint类型，并且要求在配置阶段在操作系统桌面创建应用程序的启动快捷方式。首先为我们的PublisherInfo添加处理touchpoint data的advice，NativeLauncherTouchPoint实现了ITouchpointAdvice接口，publisher在发布的时候当处理到touchpoint data部分，会查找实现了ITouchpointAdvice接口的advice。如果有advice可用，将会让这些advice处理现有的touchpoint data，并且得到新的touchpoint data，并把结果保存到metadata repository当中。\nPublisherInfo result = new PublisherInfo();\nresult.addAdvice(new NativeLauncherTouchPoint());\nNativeLauncherTouchPoint将指定为特定的IU在configure阶段执行createDesktop操作，以及相反的操作，unconfigure阶段执行deleteDesktop操作。\n更改touchpoint type的方法如下。当然也可以为现有的touchpoint type扩展action。内置的touchpoint类型和action的具体命令用法，请参考p2 wiki[3]。\niu.setTouchpointType(DesktopTouchpoint.TOUCHPOINT_TYPE);\ntouchpoint类型和action都是通过extension point来扩展的。通过扩展“org.eclipse.equinox.p2.engine.touchpoints”来添加新的touchpoint类型，扩展”org.eclipse.equinox.p2.engine.actions“将新的action同某个类型关联起来。\np2 repository publish practice 我们创建plug-in 'com.example.p2.touchpoint'来实现桌面快捷方式的扩展，并且创建'com.example.p2.feature'包含touchpoint实现的plug-in。具体实现请参考p2 example源码。\n然后为Mail Application添加p2相关feature的依赖，重新发布得到支持安装软件的新版本。并且用p2 example installer安装它。p.s: 个人感觉Eclipse在包含第三方plug-in时，层次有些问题。p2作为一个runtime的project（跟equinox, ECF同级），居然需要直接或间接依赖help, rcp.platform这样的上层模块。\n接下来创建plug-in 'com.example.mail.desktop' 和 feature 'com.example.mail.desktop.feature'，作为提供桌面快捷方式的IU。用Eclipse Export Feature将'com.example.mail.desktop.feature'导出，实际就是用PDE替我们编译打包:)。\n运行‘com.example.p2.generator'提供的headless publisher来生成我们定制的repository。’/folk/kzhu0/tmp/mail/desktop-deploy'是先前desktop feature导出后的路径，而'/folk/kzhu0/tmp/mail/desktop'是生成repository的路径。\n运行新版本的Mail Application，在Help菜单下面会多出Install New Software选项。将自定义publisher生成的Desktop feature repository添加为新的软件源，安装Mail Desktop Feature。安装完成后，将在桌面找到Mail Application的快捷方式。在Installation Detail里面将会出现这次安装的内容。选中Desktop Feature后选择卸载，桌面的快捷方式文件将会被删除掉。当然也可以使用p2 example installer来为Mail Application安装desktop feature。p.s: example代码里只实现了创建linux/unix桌面快捷方式。\nExample Code Example Code应该只能编译运行在Eclipse 3.5.x。Example Code使用的都是p2 internal API, 而p2 public API将会随Eclipse 3.6首次发布。这些类和方法基本都会保留，但命名，包一定会有重构。\nhttp://code.google.com/p/kane-toolkit/source/browse/#svn/trunk/p2-example\nReference [1]
