Days ago I updated my p2 replication tool. It's easier to install it in your Eclipse.  
A new component named 'Eclipse marketplace' is added into Eclipse SDK since Helios, which is an application store for Eclipse. People could be easy to install third party plug-ins into their Eclipse.  
  
You can launch marketplace via 'Help' - 'Eclipse Marketplace...', then search key word 'p2' or 'replication' to find the tool. Finally click next to install it.  
  
It's a very graceful workflow to install some add-ons like firefox.  
  
And then p2 replication tool could help you replicate your environment. This tool supports install components from another existing Eclipse instance to save the time cost on downloading them from Internet now! Enjoy it.
