You must see the qualifier string property when exporting your features and plug-ins by Eclipse pde. But specified qualifier string won't appear after you export the features successfully.  
  
If you want to use the qualifier string, you must define your feature and plug-in version like below:  
1.0.0.qualifier, 2.2.2.qaulifier
