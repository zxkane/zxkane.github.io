I implemented the [replication tool]({{< relref "p2-replication-plug-in.md" >}}) at the end of 2009, then published it to [Eclipse Marketplace]({{< relref "p2-replication-tool-lives-on-eclipse.md" >}}) in May 2010. However it's not pervasively used due to users have to install that plug-in firstly.  
  
I searched a similar [request](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=282419) on bugzilla, then I initialized my contribution in the early of this year. Finally it was accepted and will release as part of eclipse itself since Eclipse 3.7 M7! I hope it would benefit the users of Eclipse more and more.  
  
And I was nominated and elected as the committer of Equinox p2, it's a great honor for me. :)
