&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32">Xiaozhi hardware&lt;/a> is an impressive ESP32-based AI voice assistant capable of offline wake-up, multi-language support, and cloud connectivity. But what if you want your Xiaozhi device to access multiple AI tools, APIs, and services without managing complex integrations on the hardware side? This is where Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway shines as a unified aggregation layer for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this guide, I'll walk you through building a distributed MCP architecture that connects Xiaozhi hardware to multiple cloud services through a single WebSocket connection, leveraging AgentCore Gateway to aggregate tools ranging from simple calculators to complex RESTful APIs like real-time football data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can stop hoping your Large Language Model (LLM) follows complex instructions. &lt;strong>Context Engineering&lt;/strong> is the strategic practice of curating what enters the model's limited attention budget. To build reliable AI agents, you must master these four deterministic context patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post explores the key insights from my presentation &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fifANGCI85B4Pxz6XhLN0CeI3fTVS-ktsWfFBrhx2Do/edit?usp=sharing">Claude Code Skill(s): Mastering AI-Powered Development&lt;/a>&amp;quot;, focusing on practical patterns that transform unpredictable AI interactions into deterministic, production-ready workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-context-engineering">What is Context Engineering?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Context Engineering is the art and science of strategically managing what information an LLM processes within its limited attention window. Unlike traditional prompt engineering, which focuses on crafting individual requests, context engineering treats the entire development environment as a programmable context system.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This article provides a deep-dive technical analysis of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) authorization flow. The central insight is that MCP's authorization model is not a generic application of OAuth 2.0 but a sophisticated implementation of the emerging &lt;strong>OAuth 2.1 standard&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The MCP protocol deliberately rejects the flexible but less secure patterns of the original 2012 OAuth framework (RFC 6749). Instead, it adopts a modern, secure-by-default, and dynamic protocol stack built on three pillars:&lt;/p>
