&lt;p>You can stop hoping your Large Language Model (LLM) follows complex instructions. &lt;strong>Context Engineering&lt;/strong> is the strategic practice of curating what enters the model's limited attention budget. To build reliable AI agents, you must master these four deterministic context patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post explores the key insights from my presentation &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fifANGCI85B4Pxz6XhLN0CeI3fTVS-ktsWfFBrhx2Do/edit?usp=sharing">Claude Code Skill(s): Mastering AI-Powered Development&lt;/a>&amp;quot;, focusing on practical patterns that transform unpredictable AI interactions into deterministic, production-ready workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-context-engineering">What is Context Engineering?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Context Engineering is the art and science of strategically managing what information an LLM processes within its limited attention window. Unlike traditional prompt engineering, which focuses on crafting individual requests, context engineering treats the entire development environment as a programmable context system.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ever wished you could conjure up the perfect images for your blog posts or articles without leaving your editor? Wouldn't it be amazing to generate professional-quality visuals with just a few keystrokes while you're in your creative flow?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, grab your virtual paintbrush because we're about to dive into how you can do exactly that using GenAI's image generation capabilities with Model Context Protocol (MCP) server!&lt;/p>
