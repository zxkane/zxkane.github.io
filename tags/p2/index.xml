Our p2 based on installer suffered performance issue when querying IUs from repositories. Though the repositories have a large number of IUs to be queried, but we find the performance of using QL is unacceptable in some special scenarios.
I published several different methods to find the expected IUs. Thomas pointed out the better expression of QL and finally helped us to find out the our repository without IIndexProvider implementation.

I implemented the replication tool at the end of 2009, then published it to Eclipse Marketplace in May 2010. However it's not pervasively used due to users have to install that plug-in firstly.
I searched a similar request on bugzilla, then I initialized my contribution in the early of this year. Finally it was accepted and will release as part of eclipse itself since Eclipse 3.7 M7! I hope it would benefit the users of Eclipse more and more.

Recently our installer met a strange bug, it didn't uninstall all legacy bundles after updating to new version. Finally I found it's due to a magic fragment is missing in the profile due to some causes.
installBundle(bundle:${artifact})
uninstallBundle(bundle:${artifact})
setStartLevel(startLevel:4);
It has 'hostRequirements' element that represents it's a fragment IU and match all the eclipse's plug-ins in that profile. And this fragment defines the touch point actions for its hosts that will do installBundle action during 'install' phrase and uninstallBundle action during 'uninstall' phrase.

You would see some interesting properties at the bottom of eclipse's profile.
For example,
It attaches a property named 'org.eclipse.equinox.p2.internal.inclusion.rules' with value 'STRICT' on the IU 'org.eclipse.sdk.ide' with version 3.6.1.M20100909-0800.
It's a very important property for the p2 engine. It means the IU 'org.eclipse.sdk.ide' has been explicitly installed into the profile, so it's not allowed be implicitly updated or removed.
For example,
We have top feature IU 'org.eclipse.sdk.ide' that represents the Eclipse SDK, 'org.

I wrote a plug-in to simplify the process to install the same plug-ins in different platform or different workstation.
Anyone is interested in it, pls follow below guide to freely use it.
