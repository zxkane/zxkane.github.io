Yesterday I modified an existing c++ application for Windows. And its default build environment is Makefile and MinGW.
However I used a newly Windows API that is not included by header files of MinGW.
First of all, I copied the constant definition from header file of Windows SDK, and defined the Windows API method as a extern C method. So it's no problem to compile the code in MinGW.
Secondly I have to fix the link issue.
