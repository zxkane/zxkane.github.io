&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://constructs.dev/">Construct Hub&lt;/a> is a web portal to collect the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html">constructs&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://kane.mx/posts/2019/aws-cdk/">AWS CDK&lt;/a>, CDK8s and CDKtf.
The construct could support multiple programming languages, such as Javascript/TypeScript, Python, Java and C#.
Actually the construct is developed by TypeScript, then it's compiled as across languages library by &lt;a href="https://aws.github.io/jsii/">jsii&lt;/a>!
Any npm/pypi package with certain tags will be discovered by Construct Hub, the package will be automatically recognized as
construct package and listed in Construct Hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/projen/projen">Projen&lt;/a> is a project generator to create project with simplifying the project configuration to support dependencies management,
building, unit testing, code style linting, CI/CD via Github actions PR and actions. So &lt;a href="https://projen.io/awscdk-construct.html">projen&lt;/a>
supports the construct project out of box, which configures construct project with jsii configuration
that build the construct to across languages library, though publish the packages
to kinds of package registries, such as npmjs, pypi and maven central.&lt;/p>
