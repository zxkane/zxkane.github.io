My Gerrit server is using OpenID for user authorization, so I registered a new email account to send notification from Gerrit.
Most of email service providers require the secure authorization when using its SMTP server to send mail. However the root CA of my email provider is not added into the default certificate of JRE.</description></item><item><title>Using the certificate of Windows code signing to sign jars</title><link>https://kane.mx/posts/archive/blogspot/using-certificate-of-windows-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2011 21:03:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://kane.mx/posts/archive/blogspot/using-certificate-of-windows-code/</guid><description>I did sign the jars via reusing the existing certificate of Windows code signing several months ago. Writing it down for further reference.
Whatever your purpose of reusing the existing Windows code certificate, I only document the way from technical perspective.
After buying the certificate of Windows code signing from CA, you will get a .pvk file that stores both the certificate and private key. PVK file is the PKCS12 format[1], however java uses JKS format by default.</description></item></channel></rss>
