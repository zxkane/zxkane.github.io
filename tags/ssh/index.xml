Sometimes I need access the Intranet of company, however I don't like to create VPN connection. The connection is slow, waste time to create the connection and have to change password due to security policy.
My workstation is Linux, which has a lot of utility tools to help me access Intranet at home without VPN.
Firstly I set up a ssh server on my personal computer. It's quite easy if you are using Linux, for Windows I installed Copssh.

Setup SSH without password.
a) execute &amp;quot;ssh-keygen -t rsa&amp;quot; under your linux/unix login to get the RSA keys.
(press Enter for all)
You will get 2 files uner ~/.ssh/, id_rsa and id_rsa.pub
b) Put the public key id_rsa.pub to your remote host: ~/.ssh/authorized_keys If the remote host share the same nfs, just try &amp;quot; cat id_rsa.pub &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys&amp;quot;
* Remember to modify hostname or ip info in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys to &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, so that you can login from any host without password in your NIS domain.

ssh -qTfnN -D LocalPort remotehost
All the added options are for a ssh session that's used for tunneling.
-q :- be very quite, we are acting only as a tunnel.
-T :- Do not allocate a pseudo tty, we are only acting a tunnel.
-f :- move the ssh process to background, as we don't want to interact with this ssh session directly.
-N :- Do not execute remote command.
