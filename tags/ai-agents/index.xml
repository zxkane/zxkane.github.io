&lt;p>You can stop hoping your Large Language Model (LLM) follows complex instructions. &lt;strong>Context Engineering&lt;/strong> is the strategic practice of curating what enters the model's limited attention budget. To build reliable AI agents, you must master these four deterministic context patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post explores the key insights from my presentation &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fifANGCI85B4Pxz6XhLN0CeI3fTVS-ktsWfFBrhx2Do/edit?usp=sharing">Claude Code Skill(s): Mastering AI-Powered Development&lt;/a>&amp;quot;, focusing on practical patterns that transform unpredictable AI interactions into deterministic, production-ready workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-context-engineering">What is Context Engineering?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Context Engineering is the art and science of strategically managing what information an LLM processes within its limited attention window. Unlike traditional prompt engineering, which focuses on crafting individual requests, context engineering treats the entire development environment as a programmable context system.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Business intelligence has long been the domain of specialists, requiring complex tools and time-consuming analysis. But what if you could simply &lt;em>ask&lt;/em> your data questions in plain English and receive comprehensive, visualized answers in seconds? What if you could automate your weekly reporting with a simple conversation?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Amazon Quick Suite&lt;/strong> is AWS's answer. It's a generative AI-powered business intelligence platform designed to democratize data analysis, making it accessible to everyone in your organization—no machine learning expertise required.&lt;/p>
