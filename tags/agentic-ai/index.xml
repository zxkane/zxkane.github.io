&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you've been following the AI space, you know that &amp;quot;agents&amp;quot; are the next big thing. These autonomous, intelligent systems promise to revolutionize how we automate complex tasks. But building them can be a daunting undertaking, often involving a tangled web of conversation management, tool integration, and state tracking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if I told you there's a framework that handles the heavy lifting, letting you focus on your agent's unique logic? Enter &lt;strong>Claude Code&lt;/strong>. It has evolved beyond a simple CLI tool into a powerful AI application framework for building sophisticated AI applications.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this article, I'll share my experience building an agentic chatbot on AWS using Amazon Bedrock, Amplify Gen2, and Amplify AI kit. This project, called Industry Assistant Portal, serves as an internal industry assistant that provides industry-specific AWS solutions guidance. The chatbot leverages Amazon Bedrock's powerful foundation models and knowledge base capabilities to deliver contextually relevant information about AWS industry solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The journey of building this chatbot taught me valuable lessons about implementing agentic AI systems that can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks while maintaining context awareness. I'll cover the architecture, implementation details, challenges faced, and key learnings from this project.&lt;/p>
