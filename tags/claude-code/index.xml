&lt;p>You can stop hoping your Large Language Model (LLM) follows complex instructions. &lt;strong>Context Engineering&lt;/strong> is the strategic practice of curating what enters the model's limited attention budget. To build reliable AI agents, you must master these four deterministic context patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post explores the key insights from my presentation &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fifANGCI85B4Pxz6XhLN0CeI3fTVS-ktsWfFBrhx2Do/edit?usp=sharing">Claude Code Skill(s): Mastering AI-Powered Development&lt;/a>&amp;quot;, focusing on practical patterns that transform unpredictable AI interactions into deterministic, production-ready workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-context-engineering">What is Context Engineering?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Context Engineering is the art and science of strategically managing what information an LLM processes within its limited attention window. Unlike traditional prompt engineering, which focuses on crafting individual requests, context engineering treats the entire development environment as a programmable context system.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="the-problem-premature-input-submission">The Problem: Premature Input Submission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When working with Claude Code in a VS Code Remote SSH session (e.g., connecting from a macOS or Windows client to a remote Linux host), a common frustration arises: pressing &lt;code>Shift+Enter&lt;/code> in the terminal is supposed to create a new line for multi-line input. Instead, it often submits the current line prematurely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This behavior disrupts the workflow for crafting complex, multi-line prompts, leading to fragmented interactions and inefficient token usage.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Building on AWS is powerful but complex. What if your AI assistant had deep AWS expertise built-in? That's what &lt;strong>AWS Skills&lt;/strong> brings to Claude Code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/zxkane/aws-skills">AWS Skills&lt;/a> is a plugin that transforms Claude Code into an intelligent AWS development partner. It understands CDK best practices, estimates costs before you deploy, and guides you through serverless patterns. This post shows you how to build a serverless REST API using Claude Code supercharged with AWS Skills.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Heads up, builders! You may have noticed that Anthropic has rebranded the &lt;strong>Claude Code SDK&lt;/strong> to the new &lt;strong>Claude Agent SDK&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is more than just a new name. As the &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk">official announcement&lt;/a> explains, this change reflects a strategic focus on making it easier than ever to build, debug, and deploy powerful AI agents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you've been following our &lt;a href="https://kane.mx/posts/2025/claude-code-agent-framework/">deep dive into building agentic applications&lt;/a>, you'll be happy to know that the migration is incredibly straightforward. All the core concepts and powerful features like conversation management, MCP integration, and response streaming are still there.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you've been following the AI space, you know that &amp;quot;agents&amp;quot; are the next big thing. These autonomous, intelligent systems promise to revolutionize how we automate complex tasks. But building them can be a daunting undertaking, often involving a tangled web of conversation management, tool integration, and state tracking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if I told you there's a framework that handles the heavy lifting, letting you focus on your agent's unique logic? Enter &lt;strong>Claude Code&lt;/strong>. It has evolved beyond a simple CLI tool into a powerful AI application framework for building sophisticated AI applications.&lt;/p>
