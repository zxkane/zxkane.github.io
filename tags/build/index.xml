      <description>I successfully converted our product build from PDE build to Maven/Tycho. Something is worth to be documented here.
There are several examples and posts to demonstrate how using Tycho building your Eclipse plug-ins, features, applications and products. The most helpful example is the demo of Tycho project.
Below are some traps I met when building my project by Tycho,
  product build
Our product is based on plug-ins, however we added the &amp;lsquo;featurelist&amp;rsquo; in build.</description>

      <description>The documentation of PDE has a chapter for this topic. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s simply. Copy the template scripts what you want from templates/headless-build folder under org.eclipse.pde.build plug-in to your build configuration directory that is the folder has build.properties file.
However I found the variables listed in template &amp;lsquo;customAssembly.xml&amp;rsquo; can&amp;rsquo;t be used in the runtime. I filed bug 346370 against it.</description>
