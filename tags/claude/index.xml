&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this article, I'll share my experience building an agentic chatbot on AWS using Amazon Bedrock, Amplify Gen2, and Amplify AI kit. This project, called Industry Assistant Portal, serves as an internal industry assistant that provides industry-specific AWS solutions guidance. The chatbot leverages Amazon Bedrock's powerful foundation models and knowledge base capabilities to deliver contextually relevant information about AWS industry solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The journey of building this chatbot taught me valuable lessons about implementing agentic AI systems that can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks while maintaining context awareness. I'll cover the architecture, implementation details, challenges faced, and key learnings from this project.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This comprehensive benchmark evaluates the capabilities of 10 leading AI-powered developer tools and IDEs. The focus is on their ability to autonomously complete real-world programming tasks through natural language conversations, minimizing the need for manual coding. The evaluation excludes common features like code explanation, completion, unit testing, and documentation generation to focus on advanced AI capabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Testing Period&lt;/strong>: Late December 2024 to Mid-January 2025&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Tools Tested&lt;/strong>: 10 major AI development assistants&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Tasks Evaluated&lt;/strong>: 3 real-world programming scenarios&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: Several tools were tested across multiple versions during this period.&lt;/p>
