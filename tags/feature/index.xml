I implemented the replication tool at the end of 2009, then published it to Eclipse Marketplace in May 2010. However it's not pervasively used due to users have to install that plug-in firstly.
I searched a similar request on bugzilla, then I initialized my contribution in the early of this year. Finally it was accepted and will release as part of eclipse itself since Eclipse 3.7 M7! I hope it would benefit the users of Eclipse more and more.
