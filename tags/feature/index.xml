      <description>I implemented the replication tool at the end of 2009, then published it to Eclipse Marketplace in May 2010. However it&amp;rsquo;s not pervasively used due to users have to install that plug-in firstly.
I searched a similar request on bugzilla, then I initialized my contribution in the early of this year. Finally it was accepted and will release as part of eclipse itself since Eclipse 3.7 M7! I hope it would benefit the users of Eclipse more and more.</description>
