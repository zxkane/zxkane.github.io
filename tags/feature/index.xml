&lt;p>I implemented the &lt;a href="https://kane.mx/posts/archive/blogspot/p2-replication-plug-in/">replication tool&lt;/a> at the end of 2009, then published it to &lt;a href="https://kane.mx/posts/archive/blogspot/p2-replication-tool-lives-on-eclipse/">Eclipse Marketplace&lt;/a> in May 2010. However it's not pervasively used due to users have to install that plug-in firstly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I searched a similar &lt;a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=282419">request&lt;/a> on bugzilla, then I initialized my contribution in the early of this year. Finally it was accepted and will release as part of eclipse itself since Eclipse 3.7 M7! I hope it would benefit the users of Eclipse more and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I was nominated and elected as the committer of Equinox p2, it's a great honor for me. :)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
