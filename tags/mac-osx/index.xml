I noticed below symptoms,
Eclipse Mars can not be launched, even though I specified the launching vm to another one(`java -version` still work). The SWT native library failed to resolve the dependencies to &amp;lsquo;/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A/JavaVM&amp;rsquo; which does not exists. I tried to reinstall Oracle 1.8.0_u45 via both brew and dmg image downloaded from Oracle website, both ways were failed as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
