&lt;p>After uninstalling some applications from my Mac OSX, I found the applications that depends on JRE totally does not work. I noticed below symptoms,&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Eclipse Mars can not be launched, even though I specified the launching vm to another one(`java -version` still work). The SWT native library failed to resolve the dependencies to '/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A/JavaVM' which does not exists.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I tried to reinstall Oracle 1.8.0_u45 via both brew and dmg image downloaded from Oracle website, both ways were failed as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Mac pkg Installer can not be started due to dylib broken. It means I can't install any pkg via GUI. The command line(such as &lt;code>sudo installer -verboseR -target / -pkg /Volumes/OS\ X\ 10.10.4\ Update\ Combo/OSXUpdCombo10.10.4.pkg&lt;/code>) still works.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Finally I realized the problem was caused by I uninstalled the out of date Apple Java 6. Looks like all of above failures are required the system built-in Java. It really does not make sense the Oracle 1.8 installer script to depend on the out of date Java.&lt;/p>
