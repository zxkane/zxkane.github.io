We have a new way after doing some brain storms. This way still is not a perfect solution, but it&amp;rsquo;s much better than previous trial.
Use clearexport_ccase to export the source folder to intermittent data. See documentation of Clearcase admin. Create a temporary vob for importing the data later. See example.</description></item><item><title>Migrate Clearcase to Git</title><link>https://kane.mx/posts/archive/blogspot/migrate-clearcase-to-git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2011 19:50:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://kane.mx/posts/archive/blogspot/migrate-clearcase-to-git/</guid><description>I tried to migrate the source code of project from Clearcase to Git repository. As far as I know there is no elegant solution for such migration. For purpose of this migration, I want to keep the history and label of files in Clearcase after migrating to Git repository.
There are mature tools to migrate CVS/SVN repository to Git, so I tried to use Subversion as a bridge for my migration.</description></item></channel></rss>
