&lt;h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This article provides a deep-dive technical analysis of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) authorization flow. The central insight is that MCP's authorization model is not a generic application of OAuth 2.0 but a sophisticated implementation of the emerging &lt;strong>OAuth 2.1 standard&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The MCP protocol deliberately rejects the flexible but less secure patterns of the original 2012 OAuth framework (RFC 6749). Instead, it adopts a modern, secure-by-default, and dynamic protocol stack built on three pillars:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Building on my &lt;a href="https://kane.mx/posts/2025/invoke-mcp-hosted-on-aws-agentcore/">previous exploration of connecting to MCP servers hosted on AWS AgentCore&lt;/a>, I've been working extensively with the native MCP SDK's OAuth Client Provider to streamline authentication workflows. The MCP SDK's built-in OAuth support has evolved significantly, offering robust solutions for both interactive user authentication and machine-to-machine (M2M) flows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this follow-up article, I'll share the key improvements and special techniques I've discovered for using the MCP Client's &lt;code>OAuthClientProvider&lt;/code> with AWS AgentCore, including handling AgentCore's unique behavior with 403 responses, implementing M2M authentication flows, and leveraging automatic token refresh capabilities.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Recently, I've been exploring &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/">AWS AgentCore&lt;/a>'s new capability to host &lt;a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/a> servers, and I wanted to share my experience with connecting to these remote servers as a client. The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect with external data sources and tools, and AWS AgentCore provides a managed hosting environment for these servers with built-in authentication and scaling capabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, I'll walk through the process of invoking MCP servers hosted on &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-mcp.html">AWS AgentCore Runtime&lt;/a> or proxied via &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway.html">AgentCore Gateway&lt;/a>, covering different authentication methods, client implementation patterns, and practical considerations. What struck me most about this approach is how it bridges the gap between local development and enterprise-grade deployment while maintaining the flexibility that makes MCP so powerful.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32">Xiaozhi hardware&lt;/a> is an impressive ESP32-based AI voice assistant capable of offline wake-up, multi-language support, and cloud connectivity. But what if you want your Xiaozhi device to access multiple AI tools, APIs, and services without managing complex integrations on the hardware side? This is where Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway shines as a unified aggregation layer for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this guide, I'll walk you through building a distributed MCP architecture that connects Xiaozhi hardware to multiple cloud services through a single WebSocket connection, leveraging AgentCore Gateway to aggregate tools ranging from simple calculators to complex RESTful APIs like real-time football data.&lt;/p>
